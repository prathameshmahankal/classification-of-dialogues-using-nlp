Well, look, I again, worry about how we talk to each other and about each other, and what this last week has shown. There was a young man in my neighborhood, I watched him grow up. I lived in some high rise projects with him, named Shahad, and he was murdered on my block last year, with an assault rifle. I’m living with a sense of urgency on this problem, because when I go home to my community, like millions of Americans, we live in communities, where these weapons, where these gun shots are real every single day. And I know where the American public is. This is not about leadership. This is why when I talk about things like gun licensing and point out the differences between us, I’m not attacking people or their character or their courage on these issues. We all have courage, but it’s frustrating that when the American people, 77% of Americans, agree on licensing, we don’t need leadership right now. We just need folks who are going to stand up and follow where the people already are.
