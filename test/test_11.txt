Well, I, two things, a sane immigration policy moves the comprehensive immigration reform. It moves to a humane border policy in which, by the way, we have enough administrative judges, so that we don’t have incredible backlogs that we have right now. But to answer your question, I happen to believe that when I talk about healthcare it’s a human right that applies to all people in this country and under a Medicare for All single-payer system, we could afford to do that.
