You want to know how we get this done? We get this done by having a more courageous empathy, where people don’t wait for this hell to visit upon their communities. They stand up and understand the truth of what King said, that, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” I will lead change on this issue, because I have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine, because we forget, national shootings, these mass shootings are tragedies, but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine. Nobody has ascended to the White House that will bring more personal passion on this issue. I will fight this and bring a fight to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby like they have never seen before.
