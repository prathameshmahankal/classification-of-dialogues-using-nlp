Well, first of all, the plan we’re hearing discussed is the Biden plan, the one I put forward. Build on ObamaCare, add a public option. We can go into that, I can talk about that if you like. But here’s the deal. On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it’s awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget and we talk about how we’re going to pay for it. A study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs, but for people making between $50,000 and $75,000 year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000 because the fact is they’ll pay more in new taxes, 7.4%, plus, or 5%, plus a 4% income tax. If you’re making… If a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000. That is more than they will possibly save on this healthcare plan. We have a plan put forward that will work.
