It starts out feeling like a happy thought. This particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over, but really think about where we’ll be: Vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now.

I’m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now.
