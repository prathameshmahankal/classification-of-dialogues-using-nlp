Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tarrifs just doesn’t understand what’s going on. Look at the new NAFTA 2.0, what’s the central feature? It’s to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity so they can charge Canadians, Americans, and Mexicans more money and make more profits. That’s what trade deals have become. They have become a way for giant multi-nationals to change the regulatory environment so they can suck more profits out for themselves and to leave the American people behind. We have to have the courage to fight back against that corruption.
