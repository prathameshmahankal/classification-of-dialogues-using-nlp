If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an Amy Klobuchar-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, there will be other consequences from law enforcement. But the expectation is, that Americans will follow the law. I believe in this country, I believe in my fellow Americans, I believe that they will do the right thing.
