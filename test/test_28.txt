Well, Pete is right. It’s a question of vision, that’s what it is, whether you’re young, whether you’re old, whether you’re in between. And my vision, among other things, says that if we’re gonna fight for health care, we don’t take money from the drug companies or the insurance companies. And I have asked all of the candidates who are running to say they will not accept money from those entities who, in my view, are going to war against the American people in terms of health care. That’s a new vision. A new vision says that we must cancel completely student debt because the younger generation in this country today, for the first time in modern American history, will have a lower standard of living than their parents.
