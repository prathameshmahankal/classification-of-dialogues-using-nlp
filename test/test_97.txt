My entire career has been spent having one client and one client only, the people. I have never represented a corporation, I’ve never represented a special interest. And in this election, justice and the various injustices people are facing, regardless of where they live or their race or gender, are very much on the ballot from economic justice to reproductive justice, to healthcare justice, to educational justice. And I truly believe that when we overcome these injustices, we will then unlock the potential of the American people and the promise of America, and that’s the America I believe in, that’s the America I see, and that is why I’m running for president.
