Well, look, I have so many I don’t even know how to count them. I was the mayor of a large city that with a Republican Governor. He and I had a form of friendship even though I can write a dissertation on all our disagreements. When I got to the United States Senate, I went there with the purpose of making friendships across the aisle. I go to Bible study in Chairman Inhofe’s office. He and I passed legislation together to help homeless and foster kids. I went out to try to invite every one of my Republican colleagues to dinner. And let me again say, finding a dinner at a restaurant, agreeing on one with Ted Cruz was a very difficult thing. I’m a vegan, and he’s a meat-eating Texan.
