You know, when President Kennedy announced the moonshot, he used the phrase that sticks with me my whole life. He said, “We’re doing it because we refuse to postpone.” Well, I refuse to postpone one more minute spending billions of dollars on curing cancer, Alzheimer’s and other diseases which if we invest in them, we can find cures. I refuse to postpone giving every single child in America no matter their zip code, pre-K all the way through high school, and beyond.
