I spoke to a woman who was in the cage of nursing mothers. And she told me she had given a drink to a police officer. And that the word had come down from the gangs that she was helping the police. She knew what that meant. She wrapped up her baby and she ran for the border. We need to treat the people who come here with dignity and with respect. A great nation does not separate children from their families. We need to live our values at the border every single day.
