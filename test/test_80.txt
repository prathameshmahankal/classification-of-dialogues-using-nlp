I voted against the war in Iraq and helped lead the opposition. And it’s sad to say. I kind of had the feeling that there would be massive destabilization in that area if we went into that war. As the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I want to pick up on what Pete said, we cannot express our gratitude to all of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us, who have responded to the call of duty. But I think, also, I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of Trump’s military budgets. I don’t think we have to spend $750 billion a year on the military when we don’t even know who our enemy is.
