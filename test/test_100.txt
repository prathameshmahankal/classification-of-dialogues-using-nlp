This is a problem which continues to get worse. That’s why I’m saying it’s a state of emergency, that’s why I’m saying it’s priority one. If it isn’t priority one, it’s not going to get done. And this is something where we absolutely have to address it upfront, we have to make it the most important thing, and we can use it to rebuild and reimagine what the United States is. We can be the moral leaders of the world again while we clean up our air and water and create millions of good-paying jobs.
