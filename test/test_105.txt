So, first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. Thereâ€™s more than a hundred years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now, as a country? I have the experience of bringing people together to get something done. I have the experience of being commanded into a war zone by an American president. I have the experience of knowing what is at stake is the decisions made in those big white buildings come into our lives, our homes, our families, our workplaces and our marriages. And I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it, before it is too late.
