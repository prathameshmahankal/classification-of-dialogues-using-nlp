Well, what Kamala Harris is doing is, unfortunately, continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos, because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I’m making, the leadership and the change that I’m seeking to bring in our foreign policy. Which only makes me guess that she will, as president, continue the status quo, continue the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy of regime change wars, which is deeply destructive. This is personal to me, because I served in Iraq. I left my seat in the state legislature in Hawaii, volunteered to deploy to Iraq where I served in the medical unit, where every single day I saw the terribly high human cost of war. I take very seriously the responsibility that the president has to serve as Commander-in-Chief, to lead our armed forces, and to make sure always, no, I’m not going to put party interests first. I will put the interests of the American people above all else.
