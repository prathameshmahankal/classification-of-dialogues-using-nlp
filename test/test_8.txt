Tonight in America, as we speak, 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. But the healthcare industry made $100 billion in profits last year. Tonight, as we speak right now, 500,000 Americans are sleeping out on the street. And yet, companies like Amazon that made billions in profits did not pay one nickel in federal income tax. Tonight, half of the American people are living paycheck to paycheck, and yet 49% of all new income goes to the top 1%. Tonight, the fossil fuel industry continues to receive hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks, while they destroy this planet. We have got to take on Trumpâ€™s racism, his sexism, xenophobia and come together in an unprecedented grassroots movement, to not only defeat Trump, but to transform our economy and our government.
