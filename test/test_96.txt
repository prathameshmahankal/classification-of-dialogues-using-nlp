Sure, there’s one point we’re really missing on the stage right now, which is the fact that Donald Trump’s America first policy is actually an America isolated, an America alone policy. From trade, to battling China, to the global crisis of climate change, the challenges in the Middle East, he is pulling us away from our allies, out of the Iran deal, out of the Paris Climate Accords. And on trade, he’s deciding to take on China while at the same time taking on tariff battles with all of our allies. You literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. Now, look, I’m the only person on the stage that finds Trudeau’s hair very menacing, but they are not a national security threat. We cannot go up against China alone. This is a president that has a better relationship with dictators like Duterte and Putin than he does with Merkel and Macron. We are the strongest nation on the planet earth and our strength is multiplied and magnified when we stand with our allies in common cause and common purpose. That’s how we beat China, that’s how we beat climate change on the planet earth, and that’s how American values are the ones that lead on issues of trade and workers’ rights.
