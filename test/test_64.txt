There are only two countries in the world that don’t have paid family leave for new moms: The United States of America and Papua New Guinea. That is the entire list, and we need to get off this list as soon as possible. I would pass paid family leave as one of the first things we do. I have two kids myself who are four and seven, one of whom is autistic and has special needs, and it’s breaking families’ backs. We need to start supporting our kids and families from the beginning, because by the time they’re showing up to pre-K and kindergarten, in many cases they’re already years behind. Studies have shown that two-thirds of our kids’ educational outcomes are determined by what’s happening to them at home. This is stress levels, number of words read to them as children, type of neighborhood, whether a parent has time to spend with them. So we need to have a freedom dividend in place from day one, $1000 a month, for every American adult, which would put in many cases $2000 a month into families’ pockets so that they can either pay for child care, or if they want, stay home with the child.
