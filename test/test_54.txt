Bernie was talking about some of the battleground states, in which we compete. There’s a new battleground state, Texas. And it has 38 electoral college votes. And the way that we put it in play was by going to each one of those 254 counties, no matter how red or rural, we did not write you off. No matter how blue or urban, we did not take you for granted and we didn’t trim our sales either. We had the courage of our convictions, talking about universal healthcare, comprehensive immigration reform, and confronting the challenge of climate before it is too late. We brought everyone in and now we have a chance to beat Donald Trump with Texas.
