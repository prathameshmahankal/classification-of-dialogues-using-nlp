There’s a larger battle going on on the planet Earth right now between totalitarian and dictatorial countries and free democracies. And we see the score card under this president not looking so good, with China actually shifting more towards an authoritarian government, with its leader now getting rid of term limits. And so, I believe we need a much stronger policy. One that’s not led, as President Trump seems to want to do, in a transactional way, but one that’s led by American values.
