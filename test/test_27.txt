No, I don’t agree with that at all. And as serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee, working with Amy Klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure, knowing that Russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the president of the United States and will attempt to do it again, that’s a ridiculous argument he’s making. But I do want to also say this. What we’re talking about is a grave injustice. When rules apply to some, but not equally to all, and in particular when the rules that apply to the powerless don’t apply to the powerful. And so, Elizabeth Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump’s account that you did not agree.
