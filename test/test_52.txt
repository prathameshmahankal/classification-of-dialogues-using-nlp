With regard to… With regard to Iraq, the fact of the matter is that I should’ve never voted to give Bush authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do. The AUMF was designed, he said, to go in and get the Security Council to vote 15 to nothing to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons. And when that happened, he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof. I said something that was not meant the way I said it. I said from that point on, what I was argued against in the beginning, once he started to put the troops in, was that, in fact, we were doing it the wrong way, there was no plan, we should not be engaged, we didn’t have the people with us, we didn’t have our aligned… We didn’t have allies with us, etcetera.
