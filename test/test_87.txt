I’ll be very brief. Number one, I think we should decriminalize marijuana, period. And I think everyone… Anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their records expunged, be completely zeroed out. But I do think it makes sense, based on data, that we should study what the long-term effects are for the use of marijuana. That’s all it is. Number one, everybody gets out, record expunged.
