I’ve done it. I’ve brought people together. I’m always told by everybody around here things have changed, you can’t do that anymore. If we can’t, I thought the question was initially asked of the Senator, how do you unify this country? We have to unify this country. I have done it. I have done it repeatedly. And lastly, to be commander-in-chief, there’s no time for on-the-job training. I’ve spent more time in the Situation Room, more time abroad, more time than anybody up here. I know every major world leader. They know me, and they know when I speak, if I’m the president of the United States, who we’re for, who we’re against, and what we’ll do, and we’ll keep our word.
