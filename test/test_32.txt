Well, look, I agree with those who have said that this erratic haphazard trade war is hurting American families. As Amy Klobuchar said, 300,000 American jobs. It’s estimated that it’s cost $600 to the average American family. Just a couple of days ago, 60% of Americans said that they believe that we’re in for a recession next year. So when I become president, I would immediately begin to negotiate with China to ratchet down that trade war. We have leverage there. I also believe, though, that we need to return to a leader when it comes to things like human rights. We have millions of Uyghurs, for instance, in China, that right now are being imprisoned and mistreated. And in North Korea, this president is elevating a dictator. We need to stop that, we need to return to ensuring that America leads again on human rights. When it comes to this trade war, I would immediately begin ratcheting that trade war down. We have leverage in that discussion.
