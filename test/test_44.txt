No, Turkey is not US ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter. The crisis here, as I think Joe said and Pete said, is when you begin to betray people… And in terms of the Kurds, 11,000 of them died fighting ISIS, 20,000 were wounded. And the United States said, “We are with you. We’re standing with you.” And then suddenly one day, after a phone call with Erdoğan, announced by tweet, Trump reverses that policy. Now, you tell me, what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States? In other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy, because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.
