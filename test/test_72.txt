And you asked the question about leverage; if I can just respond to that one. The leverage, are you kidding? Everybody wants access to the American market. That means that we have the capacity to say right here in America, “You want to come sell goods to American consumers? Then you’ve got raise your standards. You’ve got to raise your labor standards, and you’ve got to raise your environmental standards so our companies can compete on a level playing field.” We can use trade not to undermine American workers, and not to undermine American farms, and not to undermine small businesses in this country. We can use trade to help build a stronger economy.
