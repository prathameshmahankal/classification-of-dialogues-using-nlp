What I’ve done over the last decade is to put together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to take on unchecked corporate power. We have a broken government in Washington DC. It’s been purchased by corporations. Over the last decade, with the help of the American people, we have taken on and beaten the oil companies, we have taken on and beaten the tobacco companies, we have taken on and beaten utilities, we’ve taken on and beaten the drug companies. I’ve also built one of the largest grassroots organizations in the United States. Last year, NextGen America did the largest youth voter mobilization in American history. I, also, in partnership with seven national unions, knocked on 15 million doors in 2016 and 10 million in 2018.
