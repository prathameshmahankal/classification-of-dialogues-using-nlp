Well, I think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that America’s had: 72,000 people died of opioid overdoses last year, and that’s not only a tragedy for them, it’s a tragedy for their family and their communities. And so I think we have to treat this as a health crisis. We have to move the resources and the support there to try and help people. But I think that Amy Klobuchar makes a good point.
