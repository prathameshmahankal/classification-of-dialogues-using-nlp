Every office I’ve run for, whether it be district attorney or attorney general, I was told each time, “It can’t be done.” They said, “Nobody like you has done it before. Nobody is ready for you.” When I ran for DA, I won and became the first black woman elected DA in a state of 40 million people in San Francisco. When I ran for Attorney General of California, I was elected, ’cause I didn’t listen, and I was the only black elected woman, black elected Attorney General in the state, in the country. And each time, people would say, “It’s not your time, it’s not your turn, it’s going to be too difficult, they’re not ready for you.” And I didn’t listen. And a part of it probably comes from the fact that I was raised by a mother who said many things that were life lessons for me, including, “Don’t you ever let anybody tell you who you are. You tell them who you are.”
