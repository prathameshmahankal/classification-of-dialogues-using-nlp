So let’s start by framing the problem the right way. We have a gun violence problem in this country. The mass shootings are terrible, but they got all the headlines. Children die every day on streets, in neighborhoods, on playgrounds. People die from violence, from suicide and domestic abuse. We have a gun violence problem in this country, and we agree on many steps we could take to fix it. My view on this is, we’re going to not… It’s not going to be one and done on this. We’re going to do it, and we’re going to have to do it again, and we’re going to have to come back some more until we cut the number of gun deaths in this country significantly. But here’s the deal. The question we need to ask is when we’ve got this much support across the country, 90% of Americans want to see us do… I like registration. Want to see us do background checks, want to get assault weapons off the ground… Off the streets. Why doesn’t it happen? And the answer is corruption, pure and simple. We have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry.
