One forecast recently says that it has already cost us 300,000 jobs, alright? There is soybeans that are mounting up in bins all over the Midwest in my state of Minnesota and in Iowa. So what I think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table. That’s what I would do. I wouldn’t have put all these tariffs in place and I wouldn’t have had a trade policy where on August 1st, he announces he’s going to have tariffs on $300 billion of goods. On August 13th, he cuts it in half. A week later, he says he’s going to reduce taxes. The day after that, he says he’s not going to do it. The leaders of the world are watching this and it undermines our strength as a nation. And yes, we want fair trade, but we must work with the rest of the world. And he has made a mockery of focused trade policy, which I think means enforcement, like we’ve done in Northern Minnesota, passing bills, getting President Obama to do more on that so that our workers can benefit. So we are importing, exporting goods, and making sure that is a competitive policy where our goal is that we are making things, inventing things and exporting to the world. He is defeating that goal.
