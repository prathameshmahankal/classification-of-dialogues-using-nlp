My personal commitment to you, to all of my fellow Americans is to treat you with respect and compassion, something that we in Hawaii call Aloha. Every single person deserves to be treated with respect regardless of race, religion, or gender or even your politics. Inclusion, unity, respect, aloha, these will be the operating principles for my administration. Now, Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii first back in 1959, where he expressed his appreciation for what we call the aloha spirit. He said, “We look to you for inspiration as a bold example for what you have already succeeded in the areas of racial harmony and racial justice, where we are still struggling to achieve in other sections of the country. ” He later went on to say, “As I looked out at the various faces in various colors, mingled together like the waters of the sea, I see only one face, the face of the future.”
