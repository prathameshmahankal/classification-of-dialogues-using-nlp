Well, a few months after I got elected, the law firm got a client and the client wanted those of us on the City Council to vote for a land deal. The land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply, because we relied on an underground aquifer. I didn’t think the environmental protection plan was strong enough, so I wanted to vote against it, and my constituents wanted me to vote against it. But under the ethics rules for lawyers in Texas, ’cause believe it or not, lawyers have ethics rules, you can’t just go against the interests of a client. So, I was stuck. On the one hand, I wanted to do the right thing. On the other hand, my livelihood, my student loans, my new house payment, my car payment depended on me shutting up, being conflicted out. So one day I walked into my law firm and I quit my job, and then I went and I voted against that land deal, on the City Council.
