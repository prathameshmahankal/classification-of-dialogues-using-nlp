Yeah, I think that we’re on the right track in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices in setting, as Beto O'Rourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today, and whether that’s Amazon that is leveraging its size, I think, to help put small businesses out of business, and then at the same time, short-changing a lot of its workers, not paying them as it should, not giving them the benefits they should, or it’s a number of other companies, big tech companies. We need to take a stronger stance when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices and that’s what I would do as president.
