This is personal for me. My dad, he struggled with alcoholism in his whole life, and by his third Dave WeigelI they said to him, the prosecutor, “You’ve got to face jail or you’ve got to go to treatment.” He picked treatment and he was pursued by grace and he has been sober ever since, and now he’s 91 and in assisted living, and he said to me last year, “It’s hard to get a drink around here anyway.” But he still has an AA group that visits him there. And so for me, I believe that everyone in this country, including the people in rural America, have that same right to be pursued by grace.
