I think I may be, doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdoğan. And Erdoğan understands that. You talk about should he stay in or out of NATO. He understands that he’s out of NATO, he’s in real trouble. But the fact that the matter is we have been unwilling in this administration, because we have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own re-election. What… Think what’s happened. The fact of the matter is you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO. What does the president do? He says, “I believe Vladimir Putin. I believe Vladimir Putin. I don’t believe our intelligence community.”
