When I was chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I tried to get through the most comprehensive piece of veterans’ legislation in modern American history and I failed, I only had two Republicans to vote with me in the Senate. So we had to go back to the drawing board, and I worked with John McCain, and I certainly did not get in that legislation working with McCain all that I wanted. But it turned out that we were able to pass a very, very significant piece of legislation, including $5 billion more for the Veterans Administration. And more recently, I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah, Mike Lee, and Mike understood, although he and I disagree on everything, that the US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen, and for the first time in 45 years we were able to get the War Powers Act utilized and get US… Get the votes to get the US troops out of that area.
