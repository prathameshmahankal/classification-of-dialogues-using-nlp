So, I was born and raised in Oklahoma, but I’m sure glad to be in Texas tonight. All three of my brothers served in military bases here in Texas, that was their ticket to the middle class. Me, I got my big opportunity about a half mile down the road from here, at the University of Houston, back when it cost $50 a semester. For a price that I could pay for on a part-time waitressing job, I got to finish my four-year degree and I became a special needs teacher. And after law school, my first big job was back here in Houston. By then I had two little kids and when childcare nearly brought me down, my Aunt Bee moved in and saved us all. The paths to America’s middle class have gotten a lot smaller and a lot narrower. Today, service members are preyed upon by predatory lenders, students are crushed by debt and families cannot afford childcare. I know what’s broken. I know how to fix it, and I’m going to lead the fight to get it done.
