His name is Luis, he was shot in the legs multiple times, he was shot in the side multiple times, he is still healing from his wounds in the hospital, but from his hospital bed he’s still trying to coach the Fusion girls soccer team. Memo, his co-coach, is still fighting for his life right now at Del Sol Hospital. Those two men, Jessica and Marcella, their wives, they exemplify resilience to me, and when we end this scourge of gun violence in this country, when we finally confront the racism that exists in America, when we’re defined not by our fears but instead by our aspirations and our ambitions, it will be in large part, I think, thanks to the example that El Paso has set.
