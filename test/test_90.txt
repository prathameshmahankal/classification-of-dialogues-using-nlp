And you know what, we came back four years later, and won the largest lopsided victory in our city’s history, but more than that, the lesson was there. We didn’t give up, we were taking on America’s toughest problems, from crime to poverty, and we transformed our city, creating tens of thousands of new jobs, the biggest economic expansion in our city, and as I said before, turned around our school system. There’s more work to do, but I haven’t given up on the people, I still live in that community, but this is the big lesson, my staff and my friends and my community told me, “If you want to go fast, you may have won the mayor’s race, but that’s not what life is about.” There’s an old African saying that says, “If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together.”
