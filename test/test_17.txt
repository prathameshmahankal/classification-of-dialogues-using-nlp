It was over 20 years ago that I was a law student, and moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, to serve as a tenants’ rights lawyer to try to address the challenges in my community, and I was sobered by them, the gun violence, the substandard housing, but it was my greatest mentor, a woman named Miss Virginia Jones, who challenged me. She said, “Boy, if all you see in this neighborhood is problems, that’s all there’s ever going to be, but if you’re stubborn and defiant, and can put forth a vision that can unify people, then we can make transformative change.” She was a church woman that said, “Without vision, the people will perish.” Well, that’s exactly what we did. We created extraordinary unity in our community, and we did things that other people think, thought were, was impossible. That’s the story of America. At our best, we unify, we find common cause and common purpose. The differences amongst us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party, not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose. That’s why I’m running for President, and that’s how I will lead this nation.
