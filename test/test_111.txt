Thank you. Probably Rand Paul. He and I, actually I invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bail system in the United States. He and I agree on almost nothing, but we agree on that and after we joined forces he said to me, Kamala, you know, Appalachia loves this. And it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, and I guess that’s why I’m running. I do believe that to beat Donald Trump but also to heal our country we need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.
