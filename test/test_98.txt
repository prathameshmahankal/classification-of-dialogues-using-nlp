At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice. I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash ObamaCare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning, and that’s have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies. That is what we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in four years. And I’m tired of hearing whenever I say these things, “Oh, it’s Republican talking points.” You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan that’s going to do that. I think there is a better way that is bold that will cover more people and it’s the one we should get behind.
