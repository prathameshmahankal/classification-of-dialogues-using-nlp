I don’t think you have to be the skinniest person. I don’t think you have the loudest voice on this stage. I don’t think that means that you will be the one that should be president. I think what matters is if you’re smart, if you’re competent, and if you get things done. I am the one that has passed over a hundred bills as the lead Democrat in that gridlock of Washington in Congress on this stage. I think you’ve got to win. And I am the one, Mr. Vice President, that has been able to win every red and purple congressional district as a lead on a ticket every time. I govern both with my head and my heart. And if you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.
