So I look out and I see tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their medical bills, 37 million people who decided not to have a prescription filled because they just can’t afford it. People who didn’t take the test the doctor recommended because they just can’t afford it. So here is my plan. Let’s bring as many people in and get as much help to the American people as we can as fast as we can. On day one, as president, I will do… Bring down the cost of prescription drugs, some things like insulin and EpiPens. That’s going to save tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars for people. I’m going to defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump administration. And in the first 100 days I’m going to bring in 135 million people into Medicare for all at no cost to them. Everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four income less than $50,000, I’m going to lower the age of Medicare to 50 and expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental and long-term care. And then, in the third year when people have had a chance to feel it and taste it and live with it, we’re going to vote and we’re going to want Medicare for all.
