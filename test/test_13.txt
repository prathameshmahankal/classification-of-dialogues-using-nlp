Of course I will, and the obvious answer is to say first, read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it, that showed how the President tried to obstruct justice and when Congress failed to act at that moment, and that the president felt free to break the law again and again, and again. And that’s what’s happened with Ukraine. We have to establish the principle: No one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility and we need to meet it. But I want to add one more part based on today’s testimony and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? This is not a man who had any qualifications except one, he wrote a check for a million dollars. And that tells us about what’s happening in Washington. The corruption, how money buys its way into Washington.
