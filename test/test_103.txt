I was in Las Vegas a few months ago and I visited people who are homeless, who are living in storm drainage tunnels under the Las Vegas Strip in the shadow of hotels and casinos that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, where people from around the world are spending so much money on vacations. We can do better than that. I believe that a wealth inequality tax as I proposed is part of the answer, but also Iâ€™ve proposed an inheritance tax, raising the top marginal tax rate and investing in things like universal childcare and affordable housing.
