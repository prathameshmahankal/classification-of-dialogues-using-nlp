Cory Booker: This is a voting issue. This is a voter suppression issue. Right here in this great state of Georgia, it was the voter suppression, particularly of African-American communities, that prevented us from having a Governor Stacey Abrams right now. And that is, when you have undemocratic means, when you suppress people’s votes to get elected, those are the very people you’re going to come after when you’re in office, and this bill, opposed by over 70%, the Heartbeat Bill here, opposed by over 70% of Georgians, is the result from voter suppression. This gets back to the issue about making sure we are fighting every single day that whoever is a nominee, they can overcome the attempts to suppress the votes, particularly of low income and minority voters, and particularly the Black community that you saw here in Georgia.
