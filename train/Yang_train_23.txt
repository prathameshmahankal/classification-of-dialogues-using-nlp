Andrew Yang: The truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party. The fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail, call centers, transportation, as well as to white collar workers like attorneys, pharmacists and radiologists. It does not care about our party. Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016, what did he say? He said we’re going to build a wall, we’re going to turn the clock back, we’re going to bring the old jobs back. America, we have to do the opposite of all of these things, we have to turn the clock forward, we have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible, we have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value. It is not left, it is not right, it is forward and that is where we must take the country in 2020.
