Beto O'Rourke: We are as divided and polarized as a country as we have ever been, and right now we have a President who uses fear to try to drive us further apart. To meet this challenge we have to have hope in one another and a faith in a future of this country that includes everyone. My whole life, Iâ€™ve been including people in the success of this country. Starting a small business with high value, high wage, high skilled jobs in the third poorest urban county in America. Serving on the city council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that I serve at the end of the day. And in Congress being in the minority, but working with Democrats and Republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country. And then in Texas, this last year. Traveling to every county. Not writing anybody off, not taking anyone for granted. And at the end of the day, winning more votes than any Democrat had in the history of the State. Winning independence for the first time in decades, and winning nearly half a million Republicans. And those 38 electoral college votes in Texas are now in play, and I can win them. That is how we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020 and how we bring this divided country together again in January of 2021. Thank you.
