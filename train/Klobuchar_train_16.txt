Amy Klobuchar: That’s not my record. We are here at a historically black college, and I think of an alum of that college, Barbara Jordan, and something that she once said. She said, “What the people want is simple. They want a country as good as its promise.” And that same could be said of the criminal justice system. So, when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand to make sure outside investigators handled them. I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis, but in the Prosecutor’s Office, they were handled with a grand jury. That’s how they were all handled across our state. I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself. That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did, 400 people in our office. The cases that came to us, the African-American community that came to us, they said there was no justice for their little kids. There was a kid named Byron Phillips that was shot on his front porch. No one had bothered to figure out who did it.
