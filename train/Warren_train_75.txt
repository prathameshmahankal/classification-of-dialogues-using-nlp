Elizabeth Warren: If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course we should do it. The real point here is that we need to stop this man-made crisis at the border. Trump is the one who has created this crisis and he has done it in no small part by helping destabilize the governments even further in Central America. He has withdrawn aid. That means that families have to flee for their lives, have to flee for any economic opportunity. Now, when I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families, I went down to the border, I went down there immediately. I was in McAllen, Texas, and I just hope everyone remembers what this looks like. Thereâ€™s like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men and cages of little girls and little boys.
