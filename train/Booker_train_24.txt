Cory Booker: So first of all, understand that this president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire. We literally have great generals, like Mattis, who said on the world stage, “The United States of America. There can be no better friend than the United States of America, and no greater enemy than the United States of America.” This president has turned that upside down, and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances, and partner with Russia. And so clearly, to your question, number one, we cannot allow the Russians to continue to grow in influence by abandoning the world stage. We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine and Latvia and Lithuania, but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable.
