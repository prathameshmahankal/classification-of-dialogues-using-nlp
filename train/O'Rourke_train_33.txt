Beto O'Rourke: By the end of that trip not only had we formed a friendship but we had formed trust, we worked with each other on each otherâ€™s bills. I got Will to work with me on an immigration bill, showing party leaders from either side that Republicans and Democrats could work together on an otherwise contentious issue. And then across Texas, I mentioned winning more votes than any Democrat, we won independents and Republicans in record numbers as well. I will bring people in and together to face the common challenges that we have and to make sure that America rises to this opportunity.
