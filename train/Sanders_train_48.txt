Bernie Sanders: No, he’s right. We don’t have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want. And the American people understand, today, that the current healthcare system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional. Now, you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country and yet we got 87 million uninsured, under-insured. In some cases we pay 10 times more for prescription drugs as do the people of Canada or other countries. Five hundred thousand people go bankrupt because of medically-related issues, they come down with cancer and that’s a reason to go bankrupt?
