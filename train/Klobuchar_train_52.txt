Amy Klobuchar: Like Reagan, who met and worked with Gorbachev. These issues of national security are incredibly important. I will meet with and do what is necessary to make sure that no more of our brothers and sisters in uniform are needlessly sent into harm’s way, fighting regime change wars that undermine our national security. I’ll bring real leadership and experience to the White House.
