Cory Booker: This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office, it’s a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other. The next leader is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all, not throw elbows at other Democrats that are unfair, because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic grace in our country, teach us a more courageous empathy, and remind America that patriotism is love of country, and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women. And love is not sentimentality, it’s not anemic, love is struggle, love is sacrifice, love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the Declaration of Independence that if we’re ever going to make it as a nation we must mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor. I am running for president to restore that sacred honor and if you believe in that like I do, please join me by going to corybooker.com. Thank you.
