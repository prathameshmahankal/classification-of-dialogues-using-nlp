Cory Booker: So, yes, we will call China out for its human rights violations. But not only that, we will stop engaging in things that violate American rights, because it is a human rights violation when people at our border, children are thrown in cages. Itâ€™s a human rights violations without coming to the United States Congress for an authorization for the use of military force for us to refuel Saudi jets to bomb Yemeni children. It is about time that this country is led by someone who will say the values of freedom and democracy are what we are going to lead with and begin to check China, check Putin and the other folks that are trying to undermine American values and democratic values around the globe.
