Bernie Sanders: No. But what I would support absolutely is passing major legislation. The gun legislation that people here are talking about. Medicare for All. Climate change legislation that saves the planet. I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen. And you could do it in a variety of ways. You could do that through budget reconciliation law. You have a vice president who will, in fact, tell the Senate what is appropriate and what is in order, and what is not. But I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made. And then, in fact, in terms of gun issues, picking up on Cory and Beto and everybody else. What we are looking at is a corrupt political system. And that means, whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining what’s happening in Washington or, in this case, you got an NRA, which has intimidated the President of the United States and the Republican leadership. I am proud… I am proud that year after year, I had an F rating from the NRA, and as president, I will not be intimidated by the NRA.
