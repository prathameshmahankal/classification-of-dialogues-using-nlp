Joe Biden: That will be for the voters to decide that question. Let me tell you what I think. I think we should have a debate on healthcare. I know that the Senator says she’s for Bernie. Well, I’m for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way we add to it, replace everything that’s been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one. Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for healthcare costs a lot of money, it costs $740 billion, it doesn’t cost $30 trillion, 3.4 trillion a year, it turns out, is twice what the entire federal budget is, that’s before it exists now, without interest on the debt.
