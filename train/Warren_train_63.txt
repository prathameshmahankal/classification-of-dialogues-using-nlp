Elizabeth Warren: You asked about a surprising friend, for me it would be Charles Charles Fried. Twenty-seven years ago, when I was under consideration for a job, he was someone who had been George Stephanopoulos Bush, the first, solicitor general, a deeply principled Republican. And we didn’t agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was, but he also was willing to listen to my work about what’s happening to America’s middle-class. And Charles engaged with it over and over, and ultimately is the person who made sure I got the job.
