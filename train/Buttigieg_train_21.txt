Pete Buttigieg: I believe what’s deepened divisions in the country is the conduct of this President, and we have a chance to change all of that. Look, systemic racism preceded this president, and even when we defeat him, it will be with us, that’s why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it. It’s not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one, and expect things will just get better on their own. Harms compound, in the same way that a dollar saved compound, so does a dollar stolen. And we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts us in two different countries. I have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas, marshalling as many resources as went into the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe, but this time a Douglass Plan that we invest right here at home to make sure that we’re not only dealing with things like the over-incarceration of black Americans, but also black solutions, entrepreneurship, raising to 25% the target for the federal government to do business with minority-owned businesses, investing in HBCUs that are training and educating the next generation of entrepreneurs.
