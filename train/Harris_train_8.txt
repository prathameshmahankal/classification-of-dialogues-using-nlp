Kamala Harris: I took on as the Attorney General of California, I ran the second largest department of justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. I took on the big oil companies and we saw progress. If any of you have been to Los Angeles 20 years ago you’ll remember that sky was brown, you go there now, the sky is blue and you know why? Because leader just decided to lead and we took on these big fossil fuel companies, we have some of the most important and strongest laws in the country and we made a difference and my point being, I’ve done it before and I will lead as President on this issue because we have no time, the clock is ticking, but we need courage and we need courageous leadership, we can get this done.
