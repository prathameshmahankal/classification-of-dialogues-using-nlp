Joe Biden: It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history, excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I’ve never seen a time… And I spent thousands of hours in the situation room. I’ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq. And guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what’s happening here. What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lock-down conversation with Erdoğan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now, pay that price.
