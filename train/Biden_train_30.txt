Joe Biden: I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being, having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that theyâ€™re not going anywhere and have them protected and work my way back toward what in fact needs to be done, protecting those Kurds. They lost their lives. This is shameful. Shameful what this man has done.
