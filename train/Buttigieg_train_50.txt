Pete Buttigieg: We shouldn’t have to pay farmers to take the edge off of a trade war that shouldn’t have been started in the first place. I will support farmers, but not long ago I was in Boone, Iowa, a guy came up to me, he said, “I got my Trump bailout check, but I would have rather spent that money on conservation.” By the way, this isn’t even making farmers whole, if you’re in soy beans, for example, you’re getting killed, and it’s not just what this president’s done with the trade war; in a lot of parts of the country, the worst thing is these so-called small refinery waivers which are killing those who are involved in ethanol. Look, I don’t think this president cares one bit about farmers. He keeps asking them to take one for the team. But more and more, I’m talking to people in rural America who see that they’re not going to benefit from business as usual under this president.
