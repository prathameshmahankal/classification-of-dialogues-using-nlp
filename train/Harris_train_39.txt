Kamala Harris: Look, there is a lot at stake in this election, and I’ve said it many times, I think justice is on the ballot in 2020, and it’s about economic justice, it’s about justice for children, it’s about justice for our teachers. I could go on down the list. And so the issue really is not what is the fight, the issue has to be how are we going to win? And to win, we have to build a coalition and rebuild the Obama coalition. I keep referring to that because that’s the last time we won. And the way that that election looked and what that coalition looked like was it was about having a leader who had worked in many communities, knows those communities and has the ability to bring people together. And everyone is going to have to be judged on their experience and, therefore, ability to bring folks together, around our commonalities of which I believe there are many.
