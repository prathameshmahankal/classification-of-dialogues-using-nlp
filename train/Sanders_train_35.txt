Bernie Sanders: Resilience, to me, means growing up in a rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. Professional resilience means to me, George Stephanopoulos, running for US Senate in Vermont, getting 1% of the vote; running for Governor and getting 2% of the vote. Finally becoming mayor of Burlington, Vermont with 10-vote margin. What resilience means to me is that throughout my political career, I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country, whether it is Wall Street, whether it is the insurance industry, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry, whose corruption and greed is killing people today, whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex. And I feel confident that given a life-long record, Iâ€™ve taken on powerful special interests of standing up for the working families of this country, that I will be able to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create a government and an economy that work for all of us, not just the 1%.
