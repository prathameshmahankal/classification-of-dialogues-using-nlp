Bernie Sanders: Well, Rachel, sadly, we have a president who is not only a pathological liar, he is likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America. But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what, we’re going to lose the election. Right now, you got 87 million people who have no health insurance or are underinsured. We are facing the great existential crisis of our time in terms of climate change. You got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street and you got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing. What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubble gum at the same time. In other words, we can deal with Trump’s corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country, we also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt, dominated by a handful of billionaires and that our economy is rigged, with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America. We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice.
