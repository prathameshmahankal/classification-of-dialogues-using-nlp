Pete Buttigieg: Well, it’s a mistake on the part of Republicans who enable the president, whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share. Look, the President has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the President accountable for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It’s also about the presidency itself, because a president 10 years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law, or that a president can get away with anything. But everyone on this stage, by definition, is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end. I want you to picture what it’s going to be like, what it’s actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president.
