Cory Booker: So, first of all, we must be fair. We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president from office. This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship. Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage. I understand the outrage that we all feel. But we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn’t rip us apart. Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that’s what this nation needs in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a Senator, do my duty. This president has violated his, I will do mine.
