Pete Buttigieg: Well, we need federal leadership to establish voting rights for the 21st century, because this affects every other issue that we care about. Now, the House of Representatives passed a pro-democracy, anti-corruption bill, which is one of many good bills to die in Mitch McConnellâ€™s hands in the United States Senate. We know that with the White House in the right hands, we can make, for example, election days a federal holiday. We can use carrots and sticks to induce states to do the right thing with automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, making it easier for people to vote, and, in particular, recognizing that we cannot allow the kind of racially motivated or partisan voter suppression, or gerrymandering, that often dictates the outcome of election before the voting even begins. Right now, we have politicians picking out their voters, rather than the other way around. That, compounding with what is being done to restrict the right to vote, means that our democracy is not worthy of the name.
