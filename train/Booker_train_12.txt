Cory Booker: So I’m hearing a lot of conversations on the stage that… And the way we talk about communities of color. Look, I live in a black and brown community below the poverty line. I’ve lived in public housing projects, almost for a decade, and saw the anguish of parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they don’t have a school that serves your genius. I think I’m the only person on the stage, even though I had no formal authority as mayor to run a school system, I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools, and we produced results. A lot of folks here talking about raising teacher salary, we actually did it in Newark, New Jersey and we didn’t stop there. We closed poor performing charter schools, but dagnabbit, we expanded high-performing charter schools. We were a city that said we need to find local solutions that work for our community, the results speak for themselves, we’re now the number one city in America for beat the odds schools, from high poverty to high performance.
