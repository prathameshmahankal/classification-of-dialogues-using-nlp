Cory Booker: There are a lot of people watching at home right now, listening to us, that are afraid because they are in crisis, they don’t have health insurance, their health insurance doesn’t go far enough, they can’t afford their prescription drugs. Look, I’m clear in what I believe. I believe in Medicare for All. I believe it’s the best way to rationalize the system, but dear God, I know that every one of my colleagues on this stage is in favor of universal health coverage and comes at this with the best of intentions. And I’ll tell you, there is an urgency right now, in this nation, everybody feels it. And as a person who has an ideal, I know we cannot sacrifice progress on the altar of purity. Because people in my community, they need help right now. They have high blood pressure right now. They have unaffordable insulin right now. And this must be a moment where we as Democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground, but find common ground, because we’ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president, and we cannot lose it, by the way we talk about each other or demonize and degrade each other. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. If I am the leader, I will work towards the ideal of health insurance, health coverage being a right for all Americans, but every single day I’ll join with other Democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today.
