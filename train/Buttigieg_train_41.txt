Pete Buttigieg: If I had a buck for every argument that I’ve witnessed like this I could pay for college for everybody. We need to move past what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I’ve been alive. We’re being offered a false choice. I don’t agree with the Vice President that Trump is an aberration. I don’t agree that there’s any such thing as back to normal, because here in the industrial Midwest, definitely where I live, normal didn’t work. That’s part of how we got here. That’s part of how a guy like Donald Trump managed to get within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place. But I also don’t agree with Elizabeth Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat. Yes, we have to fight. Absolutely, we have to fight for the big changes at hand, but it’s going to take more than fighting.
