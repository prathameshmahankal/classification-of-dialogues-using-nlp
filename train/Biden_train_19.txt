Joe Biden: No, I’m going to go like the rest of them do, twice over. Okay? Here’s the deal. The deal is that we’ve got this a little backwards, and by the way, in Venezuela, we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela. I know Maduro, I’ve confronted Maduro. Number two, you talk about the need to do something in Latin America. I’m the guy that came up with $740 million to see to it those three countries in fact change their system so people don’t have a chance to leave. You’re all acting like we just discovered this yesterday. Thank you very much.
