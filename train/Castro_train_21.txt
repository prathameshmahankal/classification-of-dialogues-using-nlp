Julian Castro: I don’t think it is. I wouldn’t pack the court. I think the plan that Mayor Pete mentioned is an interesting one, but I actually believe if we were selecting from one of those things, that the smarter move might be to look at term limits, or having people cycle off from the appellate courts, so that you would have a replenishment of perspective. I would also make sure that I appoint, as President, people who respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade, that we codify Roe v. Wade, and that we do away with things like the Hyde Amendment, because you shouldn’t only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money. We have to think about people who do not, people who are poor. And we have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom, but also reproductive justice, and invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her healthcare needs met.
