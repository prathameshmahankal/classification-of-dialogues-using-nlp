Joe Biden: Yeah, I was. I think it is the existential threat to humanity. It’s the number one issue, and I might add, I don’t really need kind of a lecture from my friend. While I was passing the first climate change bill and that PolitiFact said was a game changer, while I managed the $90 billion recovery plan investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time we’ve ever done it, my friend was producing more coal mines and produced more coal around the world, according to the press, than all of Great Britain produces. Now, I welcome him back into the fold here, and he’s been there for a long while. But the idea that we talk about where we started and how we are, let’s get this straight, I think it is the existential threat of all time.
