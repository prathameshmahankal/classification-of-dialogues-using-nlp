Cory Booker: The only reason that South Bend is growing right now after years of shrinking is immigration. Itâ€™s one of the reasons we acted, not waiting for Washington to create city-issued municipal IDs. So that people regardless of immigration status in our city had the opportunity to have the benefits of identification. We have an opportunity to actually get something done, but we cannot allow this to continue to be the same debate with the same arguments and the same clever lines, often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s. We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities, but our values, values of welcome, values of faith that all argue, for us to manage this humanly and in a way that marries our values with our laws.
