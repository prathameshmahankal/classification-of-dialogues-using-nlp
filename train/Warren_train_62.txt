Elizabeth Warren: Now, people who are struggling to pay healthcare are fighting today. People who are getting crushed by student loans are in a fight today. People who are getting stopped by the police, or paid less because of the color of their skin, are in a fight today. And anyone who doesn’t understand that Americans are already in these fights is not someone who’s likely to win them. For me this is about knowing what’s broken, knowing how to fix it. And yes, I’m willing to get out there and fight for it.
