Kamala Harris: I want to give credit first to Barack Obama for really bringing us this far. We would not be here if he hadn’t the courage, the talent or the will to see us this far. I want to give credit to Bernie. Take credit, Bernie. You know, you brought us this far in Medicare for All. I support Medicare for All. I always have. But I wanted to make the plan better, which I did, which is about offering people choice, not taking that from them. So, under my Medicare for All plan, people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan because that’s what people want, and I agree we shouldn’t take choice from people. But here’s the thing, everybody on this stage, I do believe, is well-intentioned and wants that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million Americans don’t have coverage. But at least five people have talked, some repeatedly, on this subject and not once have we talked about Donald Trump.
