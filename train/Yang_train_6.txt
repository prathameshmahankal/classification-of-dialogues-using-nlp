Andrew Yang: So to follow up on what Elizabeth said, why are we losing to the fossil fuel companies? Why are we losing to the gun lobby and the NRA? And the answer is this, we all know, everyone on the stage knows, that our government has been overrun by money and corporate interests. Now, everyone here has a plan to try and curb those corporate interests, but we have to face facts, money finds a way, money will find its way back in. So what is the answer? The answer is to wash the money out with people-powered money. My proposal is that we give every American a 100 democracy dollars that you can only give to candidates in causes that you like, this would wash out the lobbyists’ cash by a factor of eight to one, that is the only way we will win and as someone running for President, and I’ll tell you, there’s the people on one side and the money on the other, the only way for us to win is if we bring them together.
