Joe Biden: I’m the only one in this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them. And beat them twice. We were able to get assault weapons off the streets, and not be able to be sold for 10 years. Recent studies show that mass violence went down when that occurred. The way to deal with those guns and those AR-15s and assault weapons that are on the street, are not on the street, that people own, is to do what we do in the National Firearms Act, as it relate to machine guns, you must register that weapon. You must register it. When you register it, the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially. I’m the only one that got it moved to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it. I’ve done this. I know how to get it done. If you really want to get it done, go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued. That will change.
