Julian Castro: Well, first of all, thank you to Mark, thank you, Anderson and thank you, Erin and CNN and the New York Times and everybody who’s here tonight. You know, some of the most interesting friendships that I’ve had, have been with people different from me, either people older than me that had a lot to teach me or people who grew up very different from me, also teachers. As I was growing up, people that had a life experience that when I was growing up was beyond mine and sometimes also, and this goes to the heart of your question, I think, people who thought differently from me. Folks that I considered and have considered friends and I think that there’s a value to that.
