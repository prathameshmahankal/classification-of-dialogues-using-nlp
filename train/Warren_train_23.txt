Elizabeth Warren: Look, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost, that’s what they have to deal with and understand, families are paying for their healthcare today, families pay every time an insurance company says, “Sorry, you can’t see that specialist,” every time an insurance company says, “Sorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry, we are not covering that prescription.” Families are paying every time they don’t get a prescription filled because they can’t pay for it. They don’t have a lump checked out because they can’t afford the co-pay. What we’re talking about here is what’s going to happen in families’ pockets, what’s going to happen in their budgets, and the answer is on Medicare for All costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations, but for hard-working families across this country, costs are going to go down, and that’s how it should work, under Medicare for All in our healthcare centers.
