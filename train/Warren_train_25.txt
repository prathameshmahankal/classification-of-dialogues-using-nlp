Elizabeth Warren: So, let’s be clear about this. People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals. Doctors won’t have to hire people to fill out crazy forms. They won’t have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies, people who have sick family members won’t have to get into these battles. What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for healthcare for everyone in this country. Insurance companies last year sucked $23 billion in profits out of the system. How did they make that money? Every one of those $23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your healthcare coverage.
