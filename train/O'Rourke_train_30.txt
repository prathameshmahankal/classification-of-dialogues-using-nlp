Beto O'Rourke: Yeah. We need to set very tough, very clear transparent rules of the road. The kind of rules that we do not have today, that allow these social media platforms, where we the people have become the product, to abuse that public trust, and to do so at extraordinary profits. Right now we treat them functionally as a utility, when in reality, they’re more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see, our pictures and personal information that they share with others. We would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing. To publish that ad that Elizabeth Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president. Treat them like the publisher that they are, that’s what I will do as president. And we will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that, but I don’t think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That’s something that Donald Trump has done in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It’s not something that we should do. So tough rules of the road, protect your personal information, privacy and data and be fearless in the face of these tech giants.
