Cory Booker: The only people, though, who actually buy into this president’s hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don’t know any. We have an opportunity to build an American majority around immigration reform. In my community, a group of conservative Republicans rallied around an individual, a beloved, local individual who was deported when he went in to ICE to try to get his paperwork sorted out, because they never thought it would happen to him. In some of the most conservative rural areas of Iowa, I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow, and it’s why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America, includes Community Renewal Visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting… Not only for jobs, but for population, to embrace immigration, as we have in my city.
