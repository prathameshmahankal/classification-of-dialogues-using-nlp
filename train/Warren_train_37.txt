Elizabeth Warren: And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me… Wished me luck and hired someone else for the job. So there I am, I’m at home, I got a baby, I can’t have a job. What am I going to do? Here’s resilience. I said, “I’ll go to law school!” And the consequence was I practiced law for about 45 minutes, and then went back to my first love, which is teaching. But it let me get into fights. It gave me new tools. And the reason I’m standing here today is because I got back up, I fought back. I know what’s broken, I want to be in the fight to fix it in America. That’s why I’m here.
