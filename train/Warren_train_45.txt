Elizabeth Warren: So the data show that we’ve had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principal reason has been bad trade policy. The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations have been calling the shots on trade. Giant, multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line. I have a plan to fix that, and it’s accountable capitalism. It says you want to have one of the giant corporations in America, then by golly, 40% of your board of directors should be elected by your employees. That will make a difference when a corporation decides, “Gee. We could save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico.” When there are people on the board in the boardroom saying, “No. Do you know what that does to our company? Do you know what that does to our community, to what it does to our workers?” We also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate.
