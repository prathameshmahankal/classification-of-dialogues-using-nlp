Kamala Harris: There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare. And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die. Poor women, women of color, will die because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies. Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of womenâ€™s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.
