Tulsi Gabbard: I’m glad you asked, because I was going to say it’s not fair to ask these three about their health and their fitness to serve as president but not every other one of us. I am grateful to have been trained very well by the army and do my best to stay in shape. But here’s the real question I believe you should be asking is: Who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief? This is the most important responsibility that the president has. What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him, inviting Turkey to come in and slaughter the Kurds, show what an unfit president looks like.
