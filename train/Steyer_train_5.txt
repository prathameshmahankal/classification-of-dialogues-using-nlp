Tom Steyer: We can’t solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves, it’s an international crisis. I’ve been working on it for 10 years, taking on the corporations, but we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world. So if you look at what Mr. Trump is doing, of course he’s been bought by the oil and gas companies. But any problem that we’re going to do, but specifically climate, we’re going to have to lead the world morally. We’re going to have to lead it technologically, financially and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody, and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I’ve ever heard, and I would change it on day one in every single light.
