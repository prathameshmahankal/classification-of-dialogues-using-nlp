Beto O'Rourke: Thank you. Listen, I’m grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections that we have right now. But I also think we’re being offered a false choice between those who propose an all-or-nothing gambit forcing tens of millions off of insurance that they like that works for them to force them onto Medicare and others who want to, as the Vice President does, incrementally improve what we have, which will still leave many, maybe millions, uninsured and uncared for in a state like Texas, where the largest provider of mental healthcare services is a county jail system. We’ve got to do better. And my proposal, Medicare for America says, everyone who’s uninsured will be enrolled in Medicare. Everyone who’s insufficiently insured, cannot afford it, can move over to Medicare and those, like members of unions, who fought for the healthcare plans that work for them and their families are able to keep them. That is the best possible path forward.
