Amy Klobuchar: I so appreciate what the Congressman’s been doing. And I want to remind people here that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban. Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which, by the way, would have made a huge difference if that was in place in El Paso, in that store, where all those ordinary people showed such extraordinary courage. And certainly in Dayton, Ohio, where in 30 seconds, one man guns down innocent people. The cops got there in one minute and it still wasn’t enough to save those people. That’s what unites us. You know what else unites us? And I’ll tell you this. What unites us is that right now, on Mitch McConnell’s desk, are three bills: Universal background checks, closing the Charleston loophole and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers don’t get Amy Klobuchar-47s.
