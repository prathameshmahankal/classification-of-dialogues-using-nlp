Cory Booker: So, look, this president has broken norms, as you’ve said. He used his platforms to demean, degrade, and divide this country in ways that are repugnant and appalling. But the next president, whoever they are, is going to have to be someone who can heal and bring this nation together, this whole nation. So, absolutely, in that office I will do whatever it takes to make sure we bring this country together. But it’s not for a Kumbaya moment. We are a nation that achieves great things when we stand together and work together and fight together.
