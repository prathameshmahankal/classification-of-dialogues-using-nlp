Elizabeth Warren: So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hard-working middle class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it, that will leave behind millions of people who cannot, and I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, “Sorry, we’re not covering your expensive cancer treatments, we’re not covering your expensive treatment for Tom Steyer, we’re not covering what you need.”
