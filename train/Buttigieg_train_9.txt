Pete Buttigieg: We have all put out highly similar visions on climate. It is all theoretical. We will deal with climate, if and only if, we win the presidency. If and only if we beat Donald Trump. Nominate me and you get to see the President of the United States stand next to an American war veteran, and explain why he chose to pretend to be disabled when it was his chance to serve. Nominate me and we will have a different conversation with American voters about why the President of the United States thinks youâ€™re a sucker, when the problem in your life is your paycheck is not going up nearly as fast as the cost of housing, or the cost of education.
