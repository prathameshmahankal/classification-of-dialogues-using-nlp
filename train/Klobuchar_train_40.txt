Amy Klobuchar: And while we have had major debates about policy, we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. And we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy, but to change the tone in our politics. To look up from our phones, to look at each other, to start talking to each other, because the way we win and not just win the presidency, but take back the US Senate is by winning big and the way we win big, is with that fired-up Democratic base that’s out there today. But it is also about bringing in independents and moderate Republicans. I can lead this and I ask you to join me because I’ve done it before and I will do it again. Amyklobuchar.com. Join our team.
