Tulsi Gabbard: Yes, I would. We have seen for far too long the kind of racial bigotry, divisiveness and attacks that are unfortunately taken the lives of our fellow Americans. Leadership starts at the top. It’s important that we set the record straight and correct the racial injustices that exists in a very institutional way in our country, beginning with things that have to do with our criminal justice system, where predominantly the failed war on drugs that has been continuing to be waged in this country has disproportionately impacted people of color and people in poverty. This is something that I’ll do as president and Commander-in-Chief, is to overhaul our criminal justice system, working in a bipartisan way to do things like end the failed war on drugs, end the money bail system, enact the kinds of prison reforms and sentencing reforms that we need to see that will correct the failures of the past.
