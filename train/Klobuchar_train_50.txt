Amy Klobuchar: I agree with what the Mayor has just said, but this is a good example where he has said the right words, but I actually have the experience, and of leading 11 of the bills that are in that House-passed bill you just referred to. And I think this kind of experience matters. I have been devoted to this from the time that I’ve got to the Senate, and I think having that experience, knowing how you can get things done, leading the bills to take the social media companies to task, a bipartisan bill, to say, “Yeah, you have to say where these ads come from, and how they’re paid for.” And stop the unbelievable practice where we still have 11 states that don’t have backup paper ballots. That is my bipartisan bill, and I am so close to getting it done, and the way I get it done is if I’m president. But just like I have won statewide… And Mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official… And you did not, when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.
