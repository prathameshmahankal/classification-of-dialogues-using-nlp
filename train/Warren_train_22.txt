Elizabeth Warren: And now the question is how best can we improve on it? And I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by healthcare at the lowest possible cost. How do we pay for it? We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations are going to pay more and middle class families are going to pay less. Thatâ€™s how this is going to work.
