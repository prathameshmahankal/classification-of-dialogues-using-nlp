Elizabeth Warren: But you did it using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You did it using… You’re getting your goods on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You did it protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for. So when you make it big, when you make it really big, when you make it top one tenth of 1% big, pitch in 2 cents, so everybody else gets a chance to make it. And here’s the thing. That’s something that Democrats care about, independents care about, and Republicans care about. Because regardless of party affiliation, people understand across this country, our government is working better and better for the billionaires, for the rich, for the well-connected, and worse and worse for everyone else. We come together when we acknowledge that and say we’re going to make a real change.
