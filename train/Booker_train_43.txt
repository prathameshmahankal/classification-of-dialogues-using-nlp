They’re pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote. And they’re worried because the Democratic Party, we don’t want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that doesn’t… Isn’t trusted, doesn’t have authentic connection.
