Pete Buttigieg: The problem, Bernie Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote and that Elizabeth Warren backs is that it doesn’t trust the American people. I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you, not my way or the highway. Now, look, I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with the Anderson CooperA. I propose Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American people, and if we’re right as progressives that that public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves. I trust the American people to make the right choice for them. Why don’t you?
