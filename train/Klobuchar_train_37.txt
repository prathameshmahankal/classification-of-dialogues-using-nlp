Amy Klobuchar: I would codify Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. But what I want to do right now is just say what if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me? You know what I would say to him? I said, you knew, you said you wanted to do this in your race for president. You actually said that you wanted to put women in jail. Then you tried to dial it back and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail. That is exactly what the Alabama law is, it put doctors in jail for 99 years. You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women. You are not on the side of people of this country when over 75% of people want to keep Roe v. Wade on the book, when over 90% of people want to make sure we have available contraception. You de-funded Planned Parenthood, I would fund it again.
