Elizabeth Warren: So I think it is really important that we actually talk about what we’re willing to get in the fight for. And I just want to give one example around this. Kamala Harris rightly raised the question of economic justice. Let me give a specific example, and that is student loan debt. Right now in America, African-Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college, borrow more money while they’re in college and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out. Today in America, a new study came out, 20 years out, Whites who borrowed money, 94% of them have paid off their student loan debt, 5% of African-Americans have paid it off. I believe that means everyone on this stage should be embracing student loan debt forgiveness, it will help close the black-white wealth gap. Let’s do something tangible and real to make change in this country.
