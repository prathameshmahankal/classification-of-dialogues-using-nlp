Bernie Sanders: Yeah, okay. You’re looking, I believe, at the only member of Congress who not only voted against these disastrous trade agreements, NAFTA, PNTR with China, which cost us over 4 million jobs, but also help lead the effort against these agreements. Now, Elizabeth is absolutely right. If anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker, you’re mistaken. If they can save $0.05 cents by going to China, Mexico, or Vietnam, or any place else, that’s exactly what they will do. As president, let me tell you what I will do. These guys line up at the federal trough, they want military contracts, they want all kinds of contracts. Well, under my administration, you ain’t gonna get those contracts if you throw American workers out on the streets.
