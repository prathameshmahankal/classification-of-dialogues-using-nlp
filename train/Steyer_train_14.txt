Tom Steyer: Rachel, I’m the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the number one priority for me. Joe Biden won’t say it, Elizabeth Warren won’t say it. It’s a state of emergency and I would declare a state of emergency on day one. I would use the emergency powers of the presidency. I know that we have to do this. I’ve spent a decade fighting and beating oil companies stopping pipelines, stopping fossil fuel plants, ensuring clean energy across the country. I know that we have to do this. I also know that we can do this. I would make this the number one priority of my foreign policy as well. We can do this and create literally millions of good paying union jobs across this country. I would make sure that my climate policy was led by environmental justice and members of the communities where this society has chosen to put our air and water pollution, which are low income black and brown communities. And when we ask how are we going to pull this country together, how about this? We take on the biggest challenge in history, we save the world and we do it together. Do you think that would pull America together? I do.
