Joe Biden: No, look. Demonizing wealthy… What I talked about is how you get things done, and the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax, and I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5%. I would double it, because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who’s clipping coupons in the stock market make in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said, a school teacher and a firefighter. It’s ridiculous. And they pay a lower tax.
