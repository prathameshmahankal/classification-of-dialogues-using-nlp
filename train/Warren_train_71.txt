Elizabeth Warren: Yes. Think of it this way. Our housing problem in America is a problem on the supply side, and that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time ago, affordable housing. Also private developers, they’ve gone up to McMansions. They’re not building the little two-bedroom, one bath house that I grew up in, garage converted to be a bedroom for my three brothers. So, I’ve got a plan for 3.2 million new housing units in America. Those are housing units for working families, for the working poor, for the poor poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who are coming back from being incarcerated. It’s about tenants’ rights.
