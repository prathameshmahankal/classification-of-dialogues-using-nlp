Cory Booker: Thank you, Rachel. It’s an honor to be here tonight. I have not yet qualified for the December stage and need your help to do that. If you believe in my voice and that I should be up here, please go to CoryBooker.com, please help. I had a closing statement prepared, but I saw in the audience during the break a man named John Lewis and perhaps it’s interesting and important for me to mention why I’m so grateful to him. I’ve been calling in this whole election for our need to fight and fight the right way by bringing people together to create transformative change. Not just beat Donald Trump, that’s the floor; we need to go to the ceiling, we need to go to the mountain top. I am literally here on this stage right now because 50 years ago, there was a lawyer on a couch, who changed his life, changed his mind to get up and start representing families, one of them mine, who were discriminated against. The house I grew up in is because of that lawyer’s activity.
