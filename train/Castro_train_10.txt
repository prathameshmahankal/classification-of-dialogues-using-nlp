Julian Castro: And thank you George Stephanopoulos, to Jorge, to Linsey and to David and to all of you all for tuning in tonight. In many ways I shouldn’t be here on this stage. Castro is my mother’s name and was my grandmother’s name before her. I grew up in a single parent household, on the west side of San Antonio, going to the public schools. Eventually my brother Joaquin and I became the first in our family to become professionals, and when I got home, I took a job at the biggest law firm in town. I was making $100,000 a year in the year 2000, a few months later, I got elected to the San Antonio City Council, and the City Council at the time was only paying $1,040 a year, so everybody had another job, and my job was at the law firm.
