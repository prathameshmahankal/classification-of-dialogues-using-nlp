Elizabeth Warren: I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they’re going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I’ve taken a pledge, anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don’t ask to be an ambassador because I’m not going to have that happen. I asked everyone who’s running for president to join me in that and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say, “We are not going to give away the ambassador posts to the highest bidder.”
