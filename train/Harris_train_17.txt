Kamala Harris: That’s a great question, Anderson, because the Commander in Chief of the United States of America has, as one of her greatest priorities and responsibilities, to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have over a period of time received classified information about the threats to our security in hotspots around the world. What has happened in Syria is yet again Donald Trump selling folks out. And in this case, he sold out the Kurds, who, yes, fought with us and thousands died in our fight against ISIS. And let’s be clear, what Donald Trump has done because of that phone call with Erdoğan is basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a get out of jail free card. And you know who the winner is in this? There are four: Russia, Iran, Assad, and ISIS. This is a crisis of Donald Trump’s making, and it is on a long list of crises of Donald Trump’s making. And that’s why dude got to go, and when I am Commander in Chief, we will stop this madness.
