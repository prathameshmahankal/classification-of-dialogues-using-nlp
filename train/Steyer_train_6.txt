Tom Steyer: The reason I’m running for president is that we have a broken government, and we have a broken government because corporations have bought it. And every single one of these conversations is about that broken government. It’s about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want. It’s about the gun manufacturers buying the government and getting what they want. We need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government. I’ve put forward actual structural changes including term limits, a national referendum, the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of American citizens politically, and make it a lot easier to vote. These corporations have taken over our government and 72,000 deaths last year are the tragic result.
