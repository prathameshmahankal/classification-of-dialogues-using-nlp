Amy Klobuchar: I just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this. I’m looking at the mayor of Dayton. I met one of the survivors from that shooting. Thirty seconds, nine people killed. The public is with us on this, in a big way. The majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks right now. The majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation. There are three bills right now on Mitch McConnell’s desk, the background check bill. My bill to close the boyfriend loop holes so domestic abusers don’t get guns. The bill to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun. That’s what we should be focusing on, and I just don’t want to screw this up. When I’m president, I do want to bring in in an assault weapon ban. And I do want to put a limitation on magazine so what happened in Dayton, Ohio will never happen again, but let’s not mess this up with this fight.
