Pete Buttigieg: Well, I think about the friendships that I formed in the military, people who were radically different from me, different generation, different race, definitely different politics. And we learned to trust each other with our lives. When they got into my vehicle and when we went outside the wire, they didn’t care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend, they didn’t care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not, we just learned to trust each other. It’s like the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go to war to get there, is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important. I guess I’ll follow in the pattern tonight and point out, you could go to peteforamerica.com and read all about it. It’s also about building a sense of belonging in this country, because I think that’s what friendship and that’s what service can create, and I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems, from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self-medicating.
