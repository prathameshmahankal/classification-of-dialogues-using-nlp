Bernie Sanders: Weâ€™ll have strong border protections. But the main point I wanna make is that what Trump is doing, through his racism and his xenophobia is demonizing a group of people. And as President, I will end that demonization. If a mother and a child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path, in my view they are not criminals.
