Elizabeth Warren: Now, that didn’t happen, and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. We took a constitutional oath and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump, but understand: It’s about the next president, and the next president, and the next president and the future of this country.
