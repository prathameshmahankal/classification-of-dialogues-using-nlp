Andrew Yang: Elizabeth Warren, I’ve been talking to Americans around the country about automation, and they’re smart. They see what’s happening around them. Their main street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonald’s, every grocery store, every CVS. Driving a truck is the most common job in 29 states, including this one. Three-and-a-half million truck drivers in this country. And my friends in California are piloting self-driving trucks. What is that going to mean for the three-and-a-half million truckers or the 7 million Americans who work in truck stops, motels and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal? Saying this is a rules problems is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day.
