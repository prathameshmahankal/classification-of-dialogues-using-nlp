Amy Klobuchar: I wanna make it easier for kids to go to college. And I think we do it by focusing our resources on the people that need it most. And my problem with some of these plans is they literally would pay for wealthy kids, for Wall Street kids to go to college. There’s no difference. It says, “Everyone is free.” I don’t think that makes sense. And I’m very concerned if we do things like that. The debt we’re gonna pass on to the next generation and the next generation. So what I would do about student loan debt, is that I would allow people to refinance it at a better rate. And I would make sure that we improve those student loan repayment programs for our teachers and expand them, so that you literally over five, 10 years, can get it paid for if you go into occupations where we don’t have enough workers. I think we need to mesh what we were just talking about with the economy, with our education policy.
