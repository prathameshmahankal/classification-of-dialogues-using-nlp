Elizabeth Warren: I believe that abortion rights are human rights. I believe that they are also economic rights. And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. Understand this, when someone makes abortion illegal in America, rich women will still get abortions. It’s just going to fall hard on poor women. It’s going to fall hard on girls, women who don’t even know that they’re pregnant because they have been molested by an uncle. I want to be an America where everybody has a chance, and I know it could be a hard decision for people, but here’s the thing, when it comes down to that decision, a woman should be able to call on her mother, she should be able to call on her partner, she should be able to call on her priest or her rabbi, but the one entity that should not be in the middle of that decision is the government.
