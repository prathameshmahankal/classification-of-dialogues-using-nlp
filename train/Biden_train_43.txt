Joe Biden: Well, look, the next president of the United States is going to have to do two things: Defeat Donald Trump, that’s number one; and, number two, is going to have to… Be able to go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places and get a Senate majority. That’s what I’ll do. You have to ask yourself up here, who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place. And, secondly, who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the House and in the Senate? And by the way, I learned something about these impeachment trials. I learned, number one, that Donald Trump doesn’t want me to be the nominee. That’s pretty clear. He held up aid to make sure that… While at the same time innocent people in the Donbass are getting killed by Russian soldiers. Secondly, I found out that Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be president. So I’ve learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that are being held. But the bottom line is, I think we have to ask ourselves the honest question: Who is most likely to do what needs to be done, produce a Democratic majority in the United States Senate, maintain the House, and beat Trump?
