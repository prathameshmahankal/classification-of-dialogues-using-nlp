Andrew Yang: I was an unhappy lawyer for five whole months and I left to start a business. And I’m going to share with you all one of the secrets to entrepreneurship. If you want to start something, tell everyone you know, you’re going to do it. And then you don’t have a choice, you put your heart and soul into it. And even though I did that, my company flopped, had its mini-rise and maximum fall. Lost investors hundreds of thousands of dollars, still owed $100,000 in school debt. My parents still told people I was a lawyer, guess it was a little easier. So, I remember lying on my floor looking up, wondering how it had to come to this. Eventually, I picked myself back up, I kept working in small growth companies for another 10 years, and eventually had some success.
