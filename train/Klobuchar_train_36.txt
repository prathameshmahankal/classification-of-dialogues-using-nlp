Amy Klobuchar: Yeah, I would like to have a different take on this. I was in the private sector for 14 years, represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom market. I had a life before government and what I saw was when we got more competition there, the prices went down in a big way, in the long distance market. Well, right now, we have another Gilded Age going on, and I am the lead Democrat on the antitrust committee. I have the lead legislation, which means one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we’ve been talking about here, is breaking down some of these consolidation and also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because they’re so overwhelmed. But the issue here is this, start talking about this as a pro-competition issue, this used to be a Republican and Democratic issue, because America, our founding fathers actually wanted to have less consolidation. We were a place of entrepreneurship. We are seeing a start-up slump in this country and this means everything from tech on down.
