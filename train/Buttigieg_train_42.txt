Pete Buttigieg: Once again I want to take you back to that day after Trump has stopped being president. Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things we’ve attempted in my lifetime. Medicare for all who want it, actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the ’80s, an assault weapons ban which would be a huge deal, making college free for low- and middle-income students. Yet there are some here on this stage who say it doesn’t count unless we go even further. Free college for low- and middle-income students isn’t good enough unless we’re also paying for the children of billionaires. Immigration reform isn’t enough unless we also decriminalize border crossings. We have an opportunity to do the biggest things we’ve done in my lifetime.
