Julian Castro: That is something that the Trump administration has failed to do for all of his big talk about supporting the Venezuelan-American community. He has failed, I will not. I also believe that we need to do things like a 21st century Marshall Plan for Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, so that people can find safety and opportunity at home, instead of having to make the dangerous journey to the United States. And, under my administration, we’re going to put renewed focus on Latin America. It makes sense. They’re our neighbors, and we have a lot of things in common. It also makes sense that, because we have a country like China that is going around the world to places like Africa and Latin America, making their own relationships, strengthening those, the United States need to strengthen its partnerships in Latin America immediately.
