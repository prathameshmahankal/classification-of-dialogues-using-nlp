Kamala Harris: So, on paid family leave. It is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their 20s. People are having children in their 30s, often in their 40s, which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents, which requires a lot of work, from traveling back and forth to a hospital to daycare, to all of the activities that are required, much less the healthcare needs that are required. And what we are seeing in America today is the burden principally falls on women to do that work. And many women are having to make a very difficult choice, whether theyâ€™re going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on.
