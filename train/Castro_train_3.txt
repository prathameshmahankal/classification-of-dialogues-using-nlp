Julian Castro: Right. And I want to commend Beto for how well he has spoken to the passion and the frustration and the sadness after what happened in his home of El Paso. He’s done a great job with that. Look, a few weeks ago, a shooter drove 10 miles inspired by this President… 10 hours inspired by this President to kill people who look like me and people who look like my family. White supremacy is a growing threat to this country, and we have to root it out. I’m proud that I put forward a plan to disarm hate. I’m also proud that I was the first to put forward a police reform plan, because we’re not going to have any more Laquan McDonalds or Eric Garners or Michael Browns or Pamela Turners or Walter Scotts or Sandra Bland here from the Houston area. We need to root out racism, and I believe that we can do that, because that doesn’t represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart, they also need a leader to match that, and I will be a President that matches that.
