Pete Buttigieg: Well, the constitutional process of impeachment should be beyond politics and it is not a part of the campaign, but the President’s conduct is. The impeachable conduct that we have seen in the abuse of power that we’re learning more about in the investigations, but just to be clear, the President’s already confessed to it on television. But that’s just part of what we’ve seen. Under normal circumstances, a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all, which was the President had to confess in writing in court to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans. We are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrong-doing, but we are also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the Trump presidency comes to an end, one way or the other, running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country.
