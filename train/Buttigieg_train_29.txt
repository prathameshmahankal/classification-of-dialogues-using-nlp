Pete Buttigieg: And what I learned was that trust can be reciprocated, and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what’s worth more to you than winning. And I think that’s what we need in the presidency right now, we have to know what we are about. And this election is not about any of us up here, it is not about this President, even though it’s hard to talk of anything else some days. It’s about the people who trust us with their lives, a kid wondering if we’re actually going to make their schools safe when they’ve learned active shooter drills before they’ve learned to read. A generation wondering whether we will actually get the job done on climate change. And if we hold to that, then it doesn’t matter what happens to each of us professionally, together we will win a better era for our country.
