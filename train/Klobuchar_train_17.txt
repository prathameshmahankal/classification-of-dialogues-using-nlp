Amy Klobuchar: When I came into that office, we worked with the community groups, we put up billboards, we found the shooter, and we put him in jail. We did the same for the killer of a little girl named Tyesha Edwards, who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window. What changes did we make? Go after white collar crimes in a big way, diversify the office in a big way, worked with the Innocence Project to make sure we do much better with eye witness ID. And as a senator and as your president, I will make sure that we don’t just do the first step act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the second step act, which means the 90% of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails, let’s reduce those sentences from non-violent offenders and let’s get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison.
