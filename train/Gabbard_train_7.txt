Tulsi Gabbard: Thank you. Now, where I come from in Hawaii, many of you know, we greet each other with Aloha. It’s not a word that means hello and goodbye. It actually means something much more powerful than that. It means I come to you with respect and a recognition that we are all connected. We are all brothers and sisters, we are all God’s children. So I’ve developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially with Republicans, like Trey Gowdy, for example. He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues, we’ve developed a friendship that’s based on respect and he’s been there for me during some personally challenging times. The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided, Donald Trump must be defeated.
