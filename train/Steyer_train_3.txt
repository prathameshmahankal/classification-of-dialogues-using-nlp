Tom Steyer: As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise, 90% of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It’s seven and a quarter. If you included the productivity gains of American workers, it’d be over 20 bucks. There’s something wrong here. And that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That’s why I’m running for president because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants, healthcare, education, Green New Deal or minimum wage unless we break the power of these corporations.
