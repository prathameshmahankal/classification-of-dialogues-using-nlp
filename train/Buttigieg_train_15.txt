Pete Buttigieg: Yes. Look, around the world, we will do whatever it takes to keep America safe. But I thought I was one of the last troops leaving Afghanistan, when I thought I was turning out the lights, years ago. Every time I see news about somebody being killed in Afghanistan, I think about what it was like. To hear an explosion over there and wonder whether it was somebody that I served with, somebody that I knew, a friend, roommate, colleague. Weâ€™re pretty close to the day when we will wake up to the news of a casualty in Afghanistan, who was not born on 9/11.
