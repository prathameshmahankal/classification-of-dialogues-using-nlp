Tulsi Gabbard: This is an issue that impacts all of us as Americans and people all over the world. This is not a Democrat issue or a Republican issue, this is about the environmental threats that each and every one of us face, these are the kinds of conversations that we’re having in our town hall meetings and house parties in different parts of the country where we have Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians and Independents coming together saying, “Hey, we are all concerned about making sure that we have clean water to drink for our families, that we have clean air to breathe, that we’re able to raise our kids in a community that’s safe.” It is the hyper-partisanship in Washington, unfortunately, that has created this gridlock that has stood in the way of the kinds of progress that I would bring about, as president.
