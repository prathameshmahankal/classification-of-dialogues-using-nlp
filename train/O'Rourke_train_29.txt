Beto O'Rourke: Yes, it is, for many of the reasons that Andrew Yang just described and also just from some personal experiences I’ve had as a member of Congress, where constituents of mine have come forward. In some cases publicly at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions. I remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street, because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the VA. Now, imagine if that veteran instead of being prescribed an opioid had been prescribed marijuana, because we made that legal in America, ensured the VA could prescribe it, expunge the arrest records for those who have been arrested for possession and made sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted. I also want to agree with Amy Klobuchar: Until we hold those responsible, accountable for their actions, Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson, we’re going to continue to have this problem going on again. So, that veteran that I met and anyone with drug addiction today is not a problem for the criminal justice system, they are an opportunity for our public health system in America.
