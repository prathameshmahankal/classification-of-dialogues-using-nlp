Beto O'Rourke: That’s a mischaracterization, Anderson. I’ve got to answer this. Never took you, or anyone else on who disagrees with me on this issue, but when you, Pete Buttigieg, describe this policy as a shiny object, I don’t care what that meant to me or my candidacy, but to those who have survived gun violence, those who’ve lost a loved one to an AR-15, an Amy Klobuchar-47, March For Our Lives formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics and poll-tested politicians. That was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR-15 and an Amy Klobuchar-47.
