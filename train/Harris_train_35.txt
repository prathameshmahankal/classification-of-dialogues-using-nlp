Kamala Harris: He was bornâ€¦ He has conducted foreign policy since day one born out of a very fragile ego that fails to understand that one of the most important responsibilities of the Commander-in-Chief is to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland, and to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation, and therefore an extension of our ability to be secure, is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that, when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth and we are loyal. What Donald Trump has done, from pulling out of the Paris Agreement, to pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, to consistently turning a back on people who have stood with us in difficult times, including most recently the Kurds, points out that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the national security of our nation at this moment.
