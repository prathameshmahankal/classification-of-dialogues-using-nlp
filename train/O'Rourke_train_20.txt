Beto O'Rourke: Thank you, George Stephanopoulos. Everything that I’ve learned about resilience, I’ve learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas. In the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community in large part by the President of the United States that killed 22 people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that, nor were we defined by that. The very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us set the example for the rest of this country, we don’t see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous, we see them as foundational to our success, to our strength, and to our security and to our safety. Yesterday I was visiting with one of those victims. He’s the head coach of the Fusion, this is a girls’ soccer team of 10 and 11-year-old girls.
