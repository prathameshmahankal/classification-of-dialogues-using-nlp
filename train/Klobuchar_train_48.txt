Amy Klobuchar: We need a new foreign policy in this country, and that means renewing our relationships with our allies, it means rejoining international agreements, and it means reasserting our American values. And so, when the president did not stand up the way he should have to that killing and that dismemberment of a journalist with an American newspaper, that sent a signal to all dictators across the country, across the world that that was okay, and thatâ€™s wrong. And I want to add a few things to what my colleagues have said. First of all, the question about Russia. When we look at international agreements, we must start negotiating back with Russia, which has been a horrible player on the international scene, but the president precipitously got out of the nuclear agreement with Russia, and we must start negotiating, even though they were cheating, for the good of this world. And we must also start the negotiations for the new START Treaty, and when it comes to China, we need someone that sees the long term like I do, just like the Chinese do, because we have a president that literally makes decisions based on his next tweet, and they are in it for the long game.
