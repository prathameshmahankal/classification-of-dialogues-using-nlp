Bernie Sanders: You talked about the need to make climate change a national emergency, I’ve introduced legislation to just do that. Now, I disagree with the thrust of the original question. You asked your question and said, “What are we going to do in decades?” We don’t have decades. What the scientists are telling us, if we don’t get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we’re talking about cities all over the world, major cities going under water. We’re talking about increased drought, talking about increased extreme weather disturbances. The United Nations is telling us that in the years to come, there are going to be hundreds of millions of climate refugees, causing national security issues all over the world.
