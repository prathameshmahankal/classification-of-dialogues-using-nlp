Elizabeth Warren: I wanted to be a public school teacher since I was in second grade and, let’s be clear in all the ways we talk about this, money for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else. I’ve already made my commitment, we will have a secretary of education who has been a public school teacher. I think this is ultimately about our values. I have proposed a two-cent wealth tax on the top 1/10th of 1% in this country. That would give us enough money to start with our babies by providing universal childcare for every baby age 0 to 5, universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in this country, raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country, cancel student loan debt for 95% of the folks who’ve got it.
