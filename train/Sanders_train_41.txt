Bernie Sanders: Let me… I’m more than happy to answer your question, but I wanted to pick up on what Kamala and Cory and others have said. Let’s take a deep breath. Take a look at this opioid epidemic. You have executives, CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies making tens of millions of dollars a year. And in this particular case with the opioids, they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them. And last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit. This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country. And it’s not just the drug companies; right now, the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world. And they continue to make huge profits.
