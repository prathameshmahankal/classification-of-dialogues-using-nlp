Elizabeth Warren: So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hard-working middle class families, costs will go down. The way I see this is, I have been out all around this country, I’ve done 140 Town Halls now, been to 27 states and Puerto Rico, should have done 70,000 selfies, which must be the new measure of democracy. And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. So I’ve talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter has been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I’ve talked to the young man who has Tom Steyer and here is the thing about all of them, they all had great health insurance right at the beginning, but then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.
