Julian Castro: I think that that should be reflected more in our public life. I also believe, to just speak about the incident last week with Ellen and George Stephanopoulos W. Bush, I completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others. I believe that we should be more kind to other folks. I also believe that we should hold people to account for what they’ve done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something. And I think that we can do both of those things. I think that we can be kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions, and there are people, whether it’s our former President George Stephanopoulos W. Bush or others that should be held accountable. Just as we should be kind, we shouldn’t be made to feel shameful about holding people accountable for what they’ve done.
