Amy Klobuchar: For me, it’s John McCain and I miss him every day. I traveled all over the world with him and he would sometimes, when we were seated with world leaders and they would look away from me, he’d say, “Amy Klobuchar is a lead Democrat on this trip, and she will go next.” And I still remember being there at his ranch, John and I went to visit him and Cindy when he was dying and he pointed to some words in his book, because he could hardly talk. And the words said this, “There is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.” That’s what we’re doing right now.
