Amy Klobuchar: Thank you. You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels. And your answer was yes, the fact-checkers can check this out. But your point about judgment is absolutely correct. Our commander-in-chief does need to have good judgment. And what youâ€™ve just pointed out, is that you would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends, to ensure the peace and national security of our nation. I take the example of those leaders who have come before us. Leaders like JFK, who met with Khrushchev. Like Roosevelt, who met with Stalin.
