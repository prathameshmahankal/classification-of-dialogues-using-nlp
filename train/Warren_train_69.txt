Elizabeth Warren: Sure. So let me just tell you what we can do with that 2 cent wealth tax. Two cents on the top one tenth of 1% in this country and we can provide universal child care for every baby in this country age zero to five. That is transformative. We can provide universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in America. We can stop exploiting the women, largely black and brown women, who do this work. And we can raise the wages of every child care worker and pre-school teacher in America. We can put 800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition free for every kid. We can put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities and we can cancel student loan debt for 95% of the folks who’ve got it. Two cent wealth tax and we can invest in an entire generation’s future.
