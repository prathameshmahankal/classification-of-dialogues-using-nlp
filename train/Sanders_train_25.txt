Bernie Sanders: We need a healthcare system that guarantees healthcare to all people, as every other major country does. Not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies. And to tell you how absurd the system is tonight on ABC, the healthcare industry will be advertising, telling you how bad Medicare for All is, because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd.
