Elizabeth Warren: I want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our dreamers, but also for their grandparents and for their cousins, for people who’ve overstayed student visas and for people who came here to work in the fields. I want to have a system that is a path to citizenship that is fair and achievable. Down at the border we’ve got to rework this entirely. A system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist, a criminal and a 12-year-old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer and it is not serving our values.
