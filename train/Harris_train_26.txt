Kamala Harris: And I’ll tell you, my mother was 19 when she left India alone and she wanted to travel to learn science, because her mission in life was to cure cancer, and so she arrived in California and she got… She was supposed to have an arranged marriage, but she got involved in the Civil Rights movement, she met my father and that produced my sister and me, they got married, but when I was five that marriage ended. But my mother convinced us that we could do anything, and so I became the first woman Attorney General of California, the second black woman elected to the United States Senate. And I will tell you, that’s part of why I’m running, because Donald Trump, if he had his way, my story would not be possible, and I am running to make sure that that dream, the American dream, American values, American ideals, will always hold true. And so that’s what is at stake in this election, and I believe I am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak the story of the American dream and the need to reclaim it.
