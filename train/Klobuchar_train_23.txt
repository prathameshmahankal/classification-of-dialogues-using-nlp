Amy Klobuchar: So I went to the legislature, our state legislature, not an elected official, a mom, and I advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48-hour hospital stay. And when they tried to delay the implementation of that law, I brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee, so they outnumbered the lobbyists two to one. And when they said, “When should it take place?” They all raised their hand, and said, “Now.” That is what motivated me to go into public service and when I got to that gridlock of Washington DC, I got to work and pass over 100 bills and I know a lot of my friends here are from the left, but remember, I am from the middle of the country. And I believe if we’re going to get things done that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit. Someone’s going to not just change the policies. But change the tone in the country and someone who believes in America and believes it from their heart because of where they came from, that everyone should have that same opportunity.
