Joe Biden: What Latinos should look at is, comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous. Number one, we didn’t lock people up in cages, we didn’t separate families, we didn’t do all of those things, number one. Number two, by the time… This is the president who came along with the DAnderson CooperA program. No one had ever done that before. This is the president who sent a legislation to desk, saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America. This is the president who has done a great deal. So I’m proud to have served with him.
