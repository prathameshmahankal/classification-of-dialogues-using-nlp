Julian Castro: Jorge, thank you very much for that question. And look, I agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump, Donald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants, he built his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fearmongering and otherizing migrants, and that’s very different from Barack Obama. But my problem with Joe Biden, and Cory pointed this out last time, is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, “Oh, I was there, I was there, I was there. That’s me too.” And then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, “Well, that was the President.” I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama’s work, but not have to answer any questions.
