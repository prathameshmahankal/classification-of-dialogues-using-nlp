Cory Booker: Well, first of all, I’m happy to get in finally. And I just want to say, as a great New Jerseyan, Yogi Berra, said, “I am having deja vu all over again.” I’m having deja vu all over again, first of all, because I saw this play in 2016’s election. We are literally using Donald Trump’s lies. And the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. He should not have to defend ourselves and the only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump seeing that we’re distracting from his malfeasance and selling out of his office.
