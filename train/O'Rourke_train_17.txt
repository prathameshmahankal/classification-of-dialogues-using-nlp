Beto O'Rourke: And I want to say this. I’m listening to the people of this country. The day after I proposed doing that, I went to a gun show in Conway, Arkansas, to meet with those who were selling AR-15s and Amy Klobuchar-47s and those who were buying those weapons. And you might be surprised, there was some common ground there. Folks who said, “I would willingly give that up, cut it to pieces, I don’t need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself. It is a weapon of war.” So, let’s do the right thing, but let’s bring everyone in America into the conversation, Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, and non-gun owners alike.
