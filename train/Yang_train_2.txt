Andrew Yang: Everyone, we know we’re on the same team here, we know we’re on the same team, we all have a better vision for healthcare than our current president, and I believe we’re talking about this the wrong way. As someone who has run a business, I know that our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire people, makes it harder to give them benefits, and treat them as full-time employees. You instead pretend they’re contractors, it’s harder to change jobs, it’s certainly harder to start a business. The pitch we have to make to the American people is we will get the healthcare weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.
