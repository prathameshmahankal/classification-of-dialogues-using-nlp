Amy Klobuchar: I looked at this economically, and I want to make sure that we help people, because as was just pointed out, we are way behind the curve, our country is, when it comes to providing paid family leave and child care. We must do this, and we will do this if we have the right person heading up the ticket so we can win big. But what I have done with all of my plans is I have shown how I am going to pay for them, meticulously; I think that is really, really important when we have a president in the White House right now who has told over 10,000 lies. So when you look at my website, at AmyKlobuchar.com, you will see my plans, and you’re also going to see how I’m going to pay for it. And I think that is so important, because this president is literally increasing the debt, treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in a bankrupt casino, and really putting this country in a worse financial situation every single day. So yes, my plan is three months. I think that’s good. I’d love to do more.
