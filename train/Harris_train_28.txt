Kamala Harris: Because here’s the thing. For those working people who are working two or three jobs, if they don’t pay that credit card by the end of the month, they get a penalty. For the people who don’t pay their rent, they get evicted. For the people who shoplift, they go to jail. We need the same set of rules for everybody. And part of the reason I’m running for president is to say that we have to bring justice back to America for all people, and not just for some.
