Joe Biden: How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear tonight how that’s happening. Thus far, my distinguished friend, the Senator on my left has not indicated how she pays for it. And the Senator has in fact come forward and said how he’s going to pay for it, but he gets about halfway there. There’s a lot of other things that need to be done. I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at risk schools, that are Title 1 schools from $15 to $45 billion a year. But I go down the line and each of the things we’re talking about, I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done and why it’s better.
