Tom Steyer: So I’m friends with a woman from Denmark, South Carolina, named Deanna Berry, who’s fighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community. She’s a different gender, she’s a different race, she’s from a different part of the country, but she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism and her honor. My mother was a school teacher in the New York public schools, and in the Brooklyn house of detention. My father was the first generation in his family to go to college. My grandfather was a plumber. He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II, and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg. And when I asked him what that experience meant, he said, “When you see something wrong in your society, you fight it from the first day, and every single day after.” And that’s why I started the Need to Impeach Movement two years ago because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
