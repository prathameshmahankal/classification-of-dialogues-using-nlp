Elizabeth Warren: So I’m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I’m punitive. Look, I don’t have a beef with billionaires. My problem is, you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America, I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for. And all I’m saying is, you make it to the top, the top one tenth of 1%, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.
