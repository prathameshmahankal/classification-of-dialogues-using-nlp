Joe Biden: And I… It took… Kierkegaard said, “Faith sees best in the dark.” Right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident and my two sons were badly injured, and I had just been elected, not sworn in, and I lost my faith for a while. It came back. And then later, when my son, Beau, came home from Iraq and with a terminal disease, and a year later, a year-and-a-half later, losing him was like losing part of my soul. But the fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose, purpose in what you do. And that’s why I hope he’s proud of me today, because he wanted to make sure I didn’t run for president, but I stayed engaged because when you get hit badly, whether you’re losing a job or you’re raising a family, like my dad, where you have to make that longest walk up the stairs to tell your kid, “You can’t live here anymore. Dad lost his job.”
