Elizabeth Warren: So, let’s be clear, I’ve actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company. I’ve met people who like the doctors, I’ve met people who like their nurses, I’ve met people who like their pharmacists, I’ve met people who like their physical therapists. What they want is access to healthcare. And we just need to be clear about what Medicare for All is all about. Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we’re going to do this by saying everyone is covered by Medicare for All, every healthcare provider is covered and the only question here, in terms of difference is where to send the bill?
