Tom Steyer: Well, I agree with exactly what Bernie said, but I want to talk about how we’re going to win in 2020. I don’t mean to change the subject, but I think it’s sort of important that the Democratic Party not only beat Donald Trump in 2020, but have a sweeping victory across the country. And what that’s going to mean is turnout. In the United States of America, the Democratic Party keeps talking about trying to persuade a few people who are Republicans to like us, when up to half the people don’t vote at all, because they think neither party tells the truth. “No one deals with my issues. The system is broken. Why would we vote?” But what we’ve found at NextGen America is that is the start of a conversation about why votes are so important. And if you look at 2018 and flipping the house, what really happened was democratic voting went up by three quarters; in the 38 congressional districts where NextGen America was turning out young people, the turnout went up by more than a 100%.
