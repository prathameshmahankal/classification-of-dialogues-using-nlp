Elizabeth Warren: Yes. I think it should be. All three of my brothers served in the military, one was career military, the other two also served. I think it’s an important part of who we are as Americans, and I think the notion of shared service is important, it’s how we help bring our nation together. It’s how people learn to work together from different regions, people who grew up differently. It’s also about how family share that sacrifice. I remember what it was like when I was a little girl, my brother, my oldest brother who served five-and-a-half years off and on in combat in Vietnam, and what it was like for my mother every day to check to mailbox, had we heard from Don Reed? How is he doing? And if it was a letter, she was brighter than the day. And if it wasn’t, she’d say, “Well, maybe tomorrow.” This is about building for our entire nation, and I believe we should do that. I also believe we should have other service opportunities in this country, so for example, what I want to do is for our federal lands, I want to bring in 10,000 people who want to be able to serve in our federal lands, to be able to help rebuild our national forests and national parks as a way to express both their public service and their commitment to fighting back against climate change.
