Kamala Harris: When I think about this issue, it really is through the lens of my baby nieces who are one-and-a-half and three-years old. When I look at what is going to be the world if we do nothing, when they turn 20, I am really scared. And when I’ve been in the United States Senate, for now, the last two-and-a-half-years, and I look at our counterparts, the Republicans in the United States Senate, they must be looking at their children, and then when they look at the mirror, I don’t know what they see, but it’s a lack of courage. And this is an issue that, yes, it represents an existential threat. It is also something we can do something about. This is a problem that was created by human behaviors, and we can change our behaviors in a way that saves our planet, I’ve seen it happen in California.
