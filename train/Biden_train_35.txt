Joe Biden: The public is already there. Things have changed. And I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio, Alabama, etcetera, who in fact are throwing up this barrier. Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. And, in fact, every woman should have that right. And so I would not pack the court. What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the court, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan, who used to work for me, to others, that they, in fact, support the right of privacy, on which the entire notion of a woman’s right to choose is based. And that’s what I would do. No one would get on the court.
