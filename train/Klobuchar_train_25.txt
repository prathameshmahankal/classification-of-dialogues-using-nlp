Amy Klobuchar: I’d like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again. And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again. It doesn’t make America great again. It makes Russia great again, and that is what this president has done. So whether it is workers’ issues, whether it is farmers’ issue, he has put his own private interests and I will not do that.
