Amy Klobuchar: This is how we build a coalition, so we don’t just beat Donald Trump, we bring the US Senate to some sense, we send Mitch McConnell packing, this is how we win. So if you want to join us, and remember that this won’t be for me a personal victory, it’ll be a national victory of someone that wins in red districts and suburban purple districts and bright blue districts every single time. If you want to join us, and if you believe that our work doesn’t end on election day, but begins on inauguration day, join us, amyklobuchar.com, thank you.
