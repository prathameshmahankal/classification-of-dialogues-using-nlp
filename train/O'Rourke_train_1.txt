Beto O'Rourke: The answer is no, the middle class will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every American is guaranteed world-class healthcare. I think we’re being offered a false choice. Some who want to improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins, others who want a Medicare for All program that will force people off of private insurance. I have a better path. Medicare for America, everyone who’s uninsured is enrolled in Medicare tomorrow. Those who are insufficiently insured are enrolled in Medicare.
