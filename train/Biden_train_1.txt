Joe Biden: I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change and leading the world in taking on climate change. Look, this is the United States of America, there’s never been a single solitary time when we’ve set our mind to something and we’ve not able to do it. We’re walking around with our heads down like, “Woe is me.” We’re the best equipped nation in the world to take this on, it’s no longer time to postpone, we should get moving. There’s enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump.
