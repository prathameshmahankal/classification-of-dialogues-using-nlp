Bernie Sanders: I am the son of an immigrant, a young man of 17 who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. I have some sense of the immigrant experience. I will stand with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country. At the age of 21, as a member of a civil rights group at the University of Chicago, I was arrested, spent the night in jail. And I have been committed to the fight against all forms of discrimination, racial discrimination, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and religious bigotry. I will lead an administration that will look like America, will end the divisiveness brought by Trump and bring us together.
