Amy Klobuchar: Thank you. You know, this isn’t a flyover part of the country to me. The heartland is where I live. And I want to win those states that we lost last time and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t get any of this done, on climate change or immigration reform, unless they win. And what I have done is win, I’m the only one up here, time and time again the reddest of red districts. Michele Bachmann’s, I won that district three times. Rural districts that border Iowa and North and South Dakota. And I do it by going not just where it’s comfortable but where it’s uncomfortable. And that is why I have been in Pennsylvania, and in Michigan, and in Wisconsin, and all over Ohio and in Iowa. Because I think we need to build a blue Democratic wall around those states.
