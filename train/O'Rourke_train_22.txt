Beto O'Rourke: Yes, we must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold Russia accountable for invading the world’s greatest democracy, and being able to do it, thanks to Donald Trump functionally with impunity so far, so much so, that they are invading this democracy right now as we speak, still at the invitation of this president. So if there are not consequences, we will continue to see this problem going forward. But in addition, y ademas, to answer the previous question that you asked. How do we stand up to Russia on the global stage? We do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships. That is what makes America stronger. There isn’t enough money in this country. There aren’t enough service members as brave and courageous as they are to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world, and the Kurds are a case in point. In fact, because we turned our backs on them, those Kurds who fought for us in Syria, helped to defeat ISIS, not just for themselves, but for the United States of America, it makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of service members to fight those battles there.
