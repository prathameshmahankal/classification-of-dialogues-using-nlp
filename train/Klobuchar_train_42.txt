Amy Klobuchar: Thank you. Well, I just… I’m someone that doesn’t come from money, and I appreciate the work of Tom Steyer. But right now, we have a system that’s not fair, and it’s not just fair for money. And so what I would do is start a constitutional amendment and pass it to overturn Citizens United. That’s what we should do so that we stop this dark money and outside money from coming into our politics. I have led the way on voting. And I can tell you right now, one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be to allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18. If we had a system like this, and we did something about gerrymandering, and we stopped the voting purges, and we did something significant about making sure we don’t have money in politics from the outside, Stacey Abrams would be governor of this state right now.
