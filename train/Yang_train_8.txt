Andrew Yang: We need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized tests which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human worth. But here’s the big one, the data clearly shows that 65% to 70% of our students’ outcomes are determined outside of the school. We’re talking about time spent at home with the parents, words read to them when they’re young, stress levels in their house, income, type of neighborhood, we’re putting money into schools, and educators know this, we’re saying you’re 100% responsible for educating our kids but you can only control 30%, they all know this. The answer is to put money directly into the families and neighborhoods to give our kids a chance to learn and our teachers a chance to teach.
