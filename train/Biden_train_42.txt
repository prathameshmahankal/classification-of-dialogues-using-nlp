Joe Biden: Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle-class, and the only way we’re going to do that is be able to reach across the aisle. My dad used to say, “A job’s about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey, it’s about your dignity.” We have to restore people’s dignity. And lastly, we have to unite the country, because, folks, it’s time we stopped walking around with our heads down. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century. So for God’s sake, get up, get up, and remember, this is the United States of America, there’s nothing, nothing we’re unable to do when we decide we’re going to do it. Nothing at all. Period.
