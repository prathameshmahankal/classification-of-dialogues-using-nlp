Pete Buttigieg: That era must be characterized not by exclusion, but by belonging. And so must our campaign. I am inviting progressives who have agreed on these issues we’ve been talking about tonight all along, moderates who are ready to be part of this coalition, and a lot of future former Republicans who I know are watching this, disgusted by what is happening in their own party and in this country. I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we’re building, and everybody is welcome in this future that we must create. I hope you go to peteforamerica.com, join this effort and help us create a better era for the American people beginning in November 2020.
