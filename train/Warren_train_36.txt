Elizabeth Warren: I mentioned earlier I’ve known what I wanted to be since second grade; I wanted to be a public school teacher. And I invested early, I used to line my dollies up and teach school. I had a reputation for being tough but fair. By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn’t have money for a college application, much less to send me off to four years at a university. And my story, like a lot of stories, has a lot of twists and turns. Got a scholarship, and then at 19, I got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over. I got a chance down the road at the University of Houston. And I made it as a special needs teacher. I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher. I could tell you what those babies looked like. I had four-to-six-year-olds. But at the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant.
