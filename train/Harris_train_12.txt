Kamala Harris: Well, it’s just being observant because he has committed crimes in plain sight. I mean, it’s shocking, but he told us who he was. Maya Angelou told us years ago, “Listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time.” During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people. He’s been selling out working people, he’s been selling out our values, he’s been selling out national security and on this issue with Ukraine, he has been selling out our democracy. Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers, then, rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must act.
