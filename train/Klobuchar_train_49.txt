Amy Klobuchar: And this president indicated early on what he was going to do and he’s done it. When he was running for office, he literally said women should go to jail, then he dialed it back and said doctors should go to jail, so no surprise that we’re seeing these kinds of laws in Georgia and Alabama where his allies are passing these bills, and what we have to remember is that the people are with us, and I predict this will be a big election… An issue in the general election, and I just can’t wait to stand across from Donald Trump and say this to him, “You know what, the people are with us.” Over 70% of the people support Roe v. Wade. Over 90% of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood and making sure that women can get the healthcare they need. He is off the track on this, and he will hear from the women of America and this is how we’re going to win this election.
