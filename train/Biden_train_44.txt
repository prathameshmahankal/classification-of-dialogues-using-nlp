Joe Biden: You know, we can do this without charging people, raising $30, $40 trillion. The fact is, that right now, the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for all. It couldn’t pass the United States Senate. Right now, with Democrats, it couldn’t pass the House. Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who doesn’t think it makes sense. We should build on ObamaCare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan, and not make people choose. Allow people to choose, I should say. If you go to the route of my two friends in my right and my left, you have to give up your private insurance. 160 million people like their private insurance. And if they don’t like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal in my plan. Drug prices go down, premiums go down across the board. But here’s the deal, they get to choose. I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest and not demand of them, what the insurance companies, they want no competition. And my friends say you have to only go Medicare for all.
