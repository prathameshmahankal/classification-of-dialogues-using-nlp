Amy Klobuchar: My challenges, and resilience have brought me up here. I grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life, and after his third Dave WeigelI, he had a choice between jail and treatment. He chose treatment, with his faith, with his friends, with our family and in his words, he was pursued by grace. And that made me interested in public service, because I feel like everyone should have that same right to be pursued by grace. And then got married, my husband’s out there somewhere, hopefully smiling, and our daughter and our daughter was born. I had this expectation we were going to have this perfect, perfect birth and she was really sick. And she couldn’t swallow and she was in and out of hospitals for a year-and-a-half, but when she was born, they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours. She was in intensive care and I was kicked out, and I thought, “This could never happen to any other mom again.”
