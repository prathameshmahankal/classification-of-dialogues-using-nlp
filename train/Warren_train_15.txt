Elizabeth Warren: What the Congressman is describing as extreme is having deals that are negotiated by American workers for American workers. American workers want those jobs and we can build the trade deals that do it. People want access to our markets all around the world. Then the answer is, let’s make them raise their standards. Make them pay their workers more, let their workers unionize, raise their environmental standards before they come to us and say they wanna be able to sell their products. Right now, the whole game is working for the big multinationals. It’s just not working for the people here in the United States, and we can change that.
