Pete Buttigieg: I don’t think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice and the choice of Medicare for all who want it which is affordable for everyone, because we make sure that the subsidies are in place allows you to get that healthcare. It’s just better than Medicare for all whether you want it or not, and I don’t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years when we could achieve that same big, bold goal and once again, we have a president… We’re competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized, even more than now, after everything we’ve been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided, why unnecessarily divide this country over healthcare when there’s a better way to deliver coverage for all.
