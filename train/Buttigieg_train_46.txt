Pete Buttigieg: Well, as President Obama commented recently, we are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago. And to me, the extraordinary potential of the moment we’re in right now is that there is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues that didn’t exist in the same way even a few years ago. Even on issues where Democrats have been on defense, like immigration and guns. We have a majority to do the right thing, if we can galvanize not polarize that majority. For example, on healthcare. The reason I insist on Medicare for all who want it as the strategy to deliver on that goal we share of universal healthcare is that that is something that as a governing strategy we can unify the American people around. Creating a version of Medicare, making it available to anybody who wants it, but without the divisive step of ordering people on to it whether they want to or not. And I believe that commanding people to accept that option, whether we wait three years, as Elizabeth Warren has proposed, or whether you do it right out of the gate is not the right approach to unify the American people around a very, very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver.
