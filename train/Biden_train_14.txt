Joe Biden: Yeah, well, look, we’re either going to make a policy or China is going to make the trade, the rules of the road. We make up 25% of the world economy. We need another 25% to join us. And I think Elizabeth Warren’s correct. At the table has to be labor and at the table have to be environmentalists. The fact of the matter is China, the problem isn’t the trade deficit; the problem is they’re stealing our intellectual property. The problem is they’re violating the WTO. They’re dumping steel on us. That’s a different issue than whether or not they’re dumping agricultural products on us. In addition to that, we’re in a position where if we don’t set the rules, we, in fact, are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules. And that’s why you need to organize the world to take on China to stop the corrupt practices that are underway.
