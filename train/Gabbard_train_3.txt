Tulsi Gabbard: As president, I will end these regime change wars by doing two things: Ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern-day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen, that have caused tens and thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve. And I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like Al-Qaeda in Syria whoâ€™ve been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war.
