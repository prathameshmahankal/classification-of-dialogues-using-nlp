Tom Steyer: Last time I was on the stage I started by saying that everybody here is more patriotic and more competent than the criminal in the White House. And I stand by that statement. But I’m different from everybody else on this stage. I know that the government in Washington DC is broken. I know that it’s been purchased by corporations and I’ve spent a decade putting together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to beat those corporations. I’m the only one on this stage who’s willing to talk about structural change in Washington itself. Term limits. That if we’re going to make bold changes we’re going to need new and different people in charge. I’m the only person on this stage who’s spent decades building an international business. Whoever of us is the Democratic nominee is going to have to face Mr. Trump or the Republican and talk about the economy, talk about growth, understand that we can make Mr. Trump, what he is, a fraud and a failure on the economy, which is his strong point.
