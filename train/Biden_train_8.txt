Joe Biden: First of all, let me say that when I came back from law school, I had job with a great and big-time law firm and left and became a public defender, because my state was under siege. When Dr. King was assassinated, we were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months. I’ve been involved from the beginning. As a young councilman, I introduced legislation to try to keep them putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with red-lining. Banks should have to lend where they operate, etcetera. The fact of the matter is that what’s happened is that we’re in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn’t be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation. Nobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime. When we were in the White House, we released 36,000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem; they should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons.
