Bernie Sanders: Yeah, but Americans don’t want to pay twice as much as other countries, and they guarantee healthcare to all people. Under my Medicare for All proposal, when you don’t pay out-of-pocket and you don’t pay premiums, maybe you’ve run into people love their premiums, I haven’t. What people want is cost-effective healthcare, Medicare for All will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her healthcare.
