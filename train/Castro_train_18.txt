Julian Castro: Thank you very much for the question. I grew up in neighborhoods where it wasn’t uncommon to hear gunshots at night, and I can remember ducking into the back seat of a car when I was a freshman in high school across the street from my school, my public school, because folks were shooting at each other. In the neighborhoods, though, let me answer this question about voluntary versus mandatory. There are two problems I have with mandatory buybacks. Number one: Folks can’t define it, and if you’re not going to door door-to-door then it’s not really mandatory. But also in the places that I grew up in, we weren’t exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door.
