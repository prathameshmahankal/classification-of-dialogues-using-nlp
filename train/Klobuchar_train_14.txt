Amy Klobuchar: On page 8 of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it, and that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance, that’s in four years. I don’t think that’s a bold idea. I think it’s a bad idea. And what I favor is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning, and that is a public option, a non-profit choice that will bring down the cost of insurance, cover 12 million more people and bring down the prices for 13 million more people. That is a bold idea.
