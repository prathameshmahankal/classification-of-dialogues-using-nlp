Amy Klobuchar: Yes, I do. And I appreciate Elizabeth’s work. But again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done and we can get this public option done and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers me about this discussion, which we’ve had so many times, is that we don’t talk about the things that I’m hearing about from regular Americans, that is longterm care. We are seeing, I once called it a silver tsunami, the aging, and then someone told me that was too negative. So I call it the silver surge, the aging of the population. We need to make it easier to get longterm care insurance and strengthen Medicaid. In this state, the state of Ohio that has been hit by the opioid epidemic, we need to take on those pharma companies and make them pay for the addiction that they have caused and the people that they have killed.
