Tulsi Gabbard: Yeah, absolutely. So really what you’re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having US troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee Syria, that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security, you would continue this policy of the US actually providing arms and support to terrorist groups in Syria like Al-Qaeda, HTom Steyer, al-Nusra, and others because they are the ones who have been the ground force in this regime change war. That’s really what you’re saying.
