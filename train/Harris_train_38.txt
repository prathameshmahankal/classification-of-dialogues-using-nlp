Kamala Harris: And I’m running for president because I believe that we have to have leadership in this country who has worked with and have the experience of working with all folks, and we’ve got to recreate the Obama coalition to win, and that means about women, that’s people of color, that’s our LSteve BullockTQ community, that’s working people, that’s our labor unions, but that is how we are going to win this election, and I intend to win.
