Kamala Harris: You asked earlier about China. It’s a complicated relationship. We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property. They dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable. We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that that presents. We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea. I am on, and I think the only person on this stage, the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Homeland Security Committee. We need a partner on the issue of North Korea. But the bottomline is this, Donald Trump in office on trade policy, he reminds me of that guy in the Wizard of Oz, when you pull back the curtain, it’s a really small dude.
