Cory Booker: So background checks and gun licensing, these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans, 83% of Americans agree with licensing. This is the issue. Look, I grew up in the suburbs. It was about 20 years ago that I came out of my home when I moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, and witnessed the aftermath of a shooting. It’s one of the reasons why shooting after shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades, this has been a crisis for me. It’s why I was the first person to come out for gun licensing. And I’m happy that people like Beto O'Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing. But this is what I’m sorry about. I’m sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change. This is a crisis of empathy in our nation. We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action.
