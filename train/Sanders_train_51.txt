Bernie Sanders: I think Joe is right; I think that it is the function of the attorney general. But what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe, and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television, they do believe that we have a president who thinks heâ€™s above the law; we have a president who has engaged in corruption; we have a president who has obstructed justice, and in my view somebody who has violated the emoluments clause. I think Joe is right; that is the function of an independent Department of Justice, but my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law.
