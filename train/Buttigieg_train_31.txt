Pete Buttigieg: Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didnâ€™t get a yes or no answer, but this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this, no plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Elizabeth Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in and the thing is, we really can deliver healthcare for every American and move forward with the boldest, biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself, but the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes or no question is Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we let you access it if you want to, and if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that too. That is what most Americans want, Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your healthcare and for your family, and it can be delivered without an increase on the middle class taxes.
