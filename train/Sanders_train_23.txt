Bernie Sanders: But we must do more, we must do more. We have got to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society, where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country. And as president, I am prepared to take them on. Yes, we will raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Yes, we will finally make sure that every American has healthcare as a human right, not a privilege. And yes, we will address the catastrophic crisis of climate change, and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.
