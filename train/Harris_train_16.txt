Kamala Harris: So when I think about this issue, I’m thinking about that dad who tonight is going to be sitting at his kitchen table after everyone’s gone to sleep, and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee, trying to figure out how he’s going to make it work. And he’s probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month, he’s going to have to start driving an Uber. And what does that mean? That means that with those two jobs, he’s going to miss his kids’ soccer games. That’s the reality for Americans today, which is why, yes, when I pass… When I get elected and pass this bill which will give the American family who makes less than $100,000 a year a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year that they can take home at up to $500 a month, that’s going to make a real difference in that man’s life. And don’t tell him that’s not a big deal when he’s trying to get through the end of the month.
