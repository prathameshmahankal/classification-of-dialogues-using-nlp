Joe Biden: It’s crazy, the teachers are… I’m married to a teacher, my deceased wife was a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We have to make sure that every single child does in fact have three, four and five-year-olds go to school. School. Not daycare, school. We bring social workers into homes of parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It’s not they don’t want to help, they don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television… Excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, make sure the kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school or a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.
