Julian Castro: And y’all saw a couple of days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth, a cop showed up at 2:00 in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew. He didn’t even announce himself, and within four seconds he shot her and killed her through her home window. She was in her own home. And so, I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door-to-door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence. And we need to address that.
