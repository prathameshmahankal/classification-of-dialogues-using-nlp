Cory Booker: Russia and Putin understand strength, and this president, time and time again, is showing moral weakness. He makes promises to the American people that he’s going to protect this nation. Well, instead of doing something to defeat ISIS, he’s now given them a foothold again. This is an American president that even right now is lying to the American public and saying he’s bringing our troops home. At the same time, he’s increasing troop presence with the Saudis while they’re involved in an unjust war that is killing tens of thousands of children in Yemen. This president is making us less safe. He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron. As president of the United States, I will stop this and restore American integrity abroad.
