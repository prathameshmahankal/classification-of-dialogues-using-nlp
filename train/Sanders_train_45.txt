Bernie Sanders: Alright? The American people do not want tax breaks for billionaires. They want the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes. A poll came out yesterday, 71% of Democrats support Medicare for all. The people of this country understand that we’ve got to make public colleges and universities tuition free. And more and more Americans, including Republicans, understand we need bold action if we’re going to save this planet for our children and our grandchildren. The way you win an election, in this time in history, is not the same old same old. You have to inspire people, you have to excite people. You’ve got to bring working people, and young people, and poor people into the political process.
