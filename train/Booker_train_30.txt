Cory Booker: Well, first of all, let’s be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio. They’re not just attacks on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country: Liberty, the ability to control your own body. But they are particularly another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty. Because this is disproportionately affecting low-income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country, it is an insult on the most fundamental ideal that human beings should control their own body. And so, the way as president of the United States I’m going to deal with this is first of all, elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House level position. And I will create the Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights in the White House and make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt that’s gone on for decades to undermine Roe v. Wade. I will fight to codify it and I will also make sure that we fight as this country to repeal the Hyde amendment so that we are leading the planet Earth in defending the global assault we see on women right now.
