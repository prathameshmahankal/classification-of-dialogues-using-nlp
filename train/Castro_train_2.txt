Julian Castro: Thank you. And I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this and of course we owe a debt gratitude to President Barack Obama. Of course, I also worked for President Obama and Joe Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan, is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered. Now, on the last debate stage in Detroit, you said that wasn’t true, when Kamala Harris brought that up, there was a fact check of that and they said that was true. I grew up with a grandmother who had type 2 diabetes, and I watched her condition get worse and worse, but that whole time she had Medicare. I want every single American family to have a strong Medicare plan available. If they choose to hold on to strong solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do that, but the difference between what I support, and what you support, Joe Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt-in, they would automatically be enrolled, they wouldn’t have to buy in. That’s a big difference, because Barack Obama’s vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered, he wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.
