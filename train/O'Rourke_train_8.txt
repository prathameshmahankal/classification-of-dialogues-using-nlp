Beto O'Rourke: We’ll call his racism out for what it is, and also talk about its consequences. It doesn’t just offend our sensibilities to hear him say “Send her back” about a member of Congress, because she’s a woman color, because she’s a Muslim-American, doesn’t just offend our sensibilities when he calls Mexican immigrants “rapists and criminals,” or seeks to ban all Muslims from the shores of a country that’s comprised of people from the world over, from every tradition of faith. It is also changing this country. Hate crimes are on the rise, every single one over the last three years. On the day that he signed his executive order attempting to ban Muslim travel, the mosque in Victoria, Texas was burned to the ground. So we must not only stand up against Donald Trump and defeat him in this next election, but we must also ensure that we don’t just tolerate or respect our differences, but we embrace them. That’s what we’ve learned in El Paso, Texas, my hometown. One of the safest cities in the United States of America, not despite, but because it’s a city of immigrants and asylum seekers, and refugees. We will show that our diversity is our strength in my administration.
