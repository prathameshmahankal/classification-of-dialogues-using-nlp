Joe Biden: No, it wasn’t wrong to pull out, but I want to answer the Afghanistan question. I’ve been in and out of Afghanistan, not with a gun, and I admire my friend for his service, but I’ve been in and out of Afghanistan I think more than anybody on this… And it’s an open secret. You reported a long time ago, George Stephanopoulos, that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan. The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counter insurgency, meaning that we’re going to put that country together. It cannot be put together. Let me say it again, it will not be put together. It’s three different countries. Pakistan owns the three counties… The three provinces in the east. They’re not any part of it, the Haqqanis run it. I will go on and on, but here’s the point. The point is that it’s a counter-terrorism strategy. We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases, insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to airlift from, and to move against what we know. We don’t need those troops there. I would bring them home. And Joe Dunford’s a fine guy, but this has been an internal argument we’ve had for eight years.
