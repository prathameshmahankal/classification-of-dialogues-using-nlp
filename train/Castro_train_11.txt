Julian Castro: And it was the first test that I had. And I think back to that because oftentimes we think of politics and you think of politics as dirty or corrupting. I wondered, before I went in, whether it would change who I was, and I was proud that when that first test came that I stood up for the people that I was there to represent and not for big special interests. There’s nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the President of the United States. This President has failed that test. But I want you to know that if you elect me President, I won’t, I won’t serve anybody except you and your family. And together, we can create an America that’s better than ever. Thank you very much.
