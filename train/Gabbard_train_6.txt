Tulsi Gabbard: This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it’s unfortunate to see how in this country, it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon. I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others. But when she said abortion should be safe, legal and rare, I think she’s correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you’re referring to can often lead to a dangerous place as we’ve seen them as they’re passed in other countries where a woman who has a miscarriage past that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point. I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.
