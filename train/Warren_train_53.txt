Elizabeth Warren: So, look, I want to get what works, done. I want to use the method we used, for example, with machine guns. We registered them, we put in a huge penalty if you didn’t register them, and a huge tax on them, and we let people turn them in, and it got machine guns out of the hands of people. But the problem here that we need to focus on is, first, how widespread gun violence is. As you’ve rightly identified, it’s not just about mass shootings, it’s what happens in neighborhoods all across this country. It is about suicide. It is about domestic violence. This is not going to be a one and done, that we do one thing or two things or three things, and then we’re done. We have to reduce gun violence, overall. And the question we have to ask is: Why hasn’t it happened? You say we’re so close, we have been so close. I stood in the United States Senate in 2013.
