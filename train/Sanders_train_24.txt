Bernie Sanders: Joe said that Medicare for All will cost over $30 trillion. That’s right, Joe. Status quo over 10 years, will be $50 trillion. Every study done shows that Medicare for All is the most cost-effective approach to providing healthcare to every man, woman and child in this country. I who wrote the damn bill, if I may say so, intend to eliminate all out-of-pocket expenses, all deductibles, all co-payments. Nobody in America will pay more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, because we’re going to stand up to the greed and corruption and price-fixing of the pharmaceutical industry.
