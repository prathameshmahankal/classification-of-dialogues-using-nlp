Joe Biden: I would not get into court packing. We add three justices, next time around we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all. I want to point out that the justices I’ve supported, when I defeated Robert Bork, and I say when I defeated Robert Bork, I made sure we guaranteed a woman’s right to choose for the better part of a generation. I would make sure that we move and insist that we pass, we codify Roe v. Wade.
