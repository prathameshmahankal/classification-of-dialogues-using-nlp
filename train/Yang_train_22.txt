Andrew Yang: First, I want to thank all the voters tuned in at home. If you don’t feel like you answered your question… You got your question answered tonight it’s understandable, there are 12 of us. I’m going to be answering voter questions for 10 straight hours this Friday. My website yang2020.com, and if you ask your question tonight there’s a better chance I’ll get to it. My surprising friendship, it’s been so much fun running for president because I’ve gotten to meet so many Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise. The friendship that sticks out for me is a guy named Fred, who’s an average Trump supporter, a trucker, he let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail, I heard about his experiences, trying to get other people off of drugs and I’m happy to say that after our ride together he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me and we’ve remained in touch ever since.
