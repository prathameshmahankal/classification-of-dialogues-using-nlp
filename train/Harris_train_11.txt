Kamala Harris: And when I look around the town halls that we do in this race for President of the United States, and I look at the meetings that we do and the community meetings, and I see these little girls and boys, sometimes even brought by their fathers, and they bring them to me, and I talk to them during these events, and they smile and they’re full of joy, and their fathers tell them, “See, don’t you ever listen and let anybody ever tell you what you can or cannot be. You have to believe in what can be, unburdened by what has been.”
