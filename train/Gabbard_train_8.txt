Tulsi Gabbard: But we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump, we need to deliver a win for the American people. We must stand united as Americans remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president, inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln, who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all. When I look out at our country, I donâ€™t see deplorables, I see fellow Americans, people who I treat with respect even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly. I will work to restore a White House that represents light and compassion and respect for every American regardless of race, religion, orientation, gender or political affiliation. So I want to ask everyone to join me. Join me in bringing about this government of, by and for the people that serves all the people of this country, and visit my website, tulsi2020.com, for more information.
