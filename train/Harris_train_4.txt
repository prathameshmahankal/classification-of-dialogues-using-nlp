Kamala Harris: Absolutely not. But my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration, about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system. I plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on day one. It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable. And finally, my plan is about making sure that in Americaâ€™s criminal justice system we de-incarcerate women and children, that we end solitary confinement, and that we work on keeping families intact. And, as President of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete.
