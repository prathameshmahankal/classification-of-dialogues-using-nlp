Julian Castro: Not at all. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. And all of us are out there every single day, talking about what weâ€™re going to do to make sure that more people cross the graduation stage, that more families have great healthcare, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio where Donald Trump has broken his promises, because Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, actually, in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them. Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller Report point out 10 different instances where the President obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is ongoingly, in an ongoing way, violating his oath of office and abusing his power. We have to impeach this president and the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.
