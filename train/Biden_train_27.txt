Joe Biden: Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are one point… There’s $1,640,000,000,000 in tax loopholes. You can’t justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time. Secondly, I mean, thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to, we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy, we’re going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody’s right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs, it is. The fact is also corporate greed, if they’re going back and not investing in their employees, they’re reinvesting and buying back their stock and still doing the same thing.
