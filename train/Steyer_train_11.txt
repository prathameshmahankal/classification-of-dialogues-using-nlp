Tom Steyer: What I’ve done is to try to push power down to the America people, to take power away from the corporations who’ve bought our government. And I’m talking now about structural reform in Washington DC. Term limits. If you want bold change in the United States, you’re going to have to have new and different people in charge. I’m the only person on this stage who will talk about term limits. Joe Biden won’t. Bernie Sanders won’t. Even Pete Buttigieg will not talk about term limits and structural change. I would let the American people pass laws themselves through direct democracy. It’s time to push the power back to the people and away from DC.
