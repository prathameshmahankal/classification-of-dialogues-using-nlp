Elizabeth Warren: And unless we’re willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster, we’re not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said, “Let’s do background checks, let’s get rid of assault weapons.” And with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster. Until we attack the systemic problems, we can’t get done reform in this country. We’ve got to go straight against the industry, and we’ve got to change Congress, so it doesn’t just work for the wealthy and well-connected. So it works for the people.
