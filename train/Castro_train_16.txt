Julian Castro: Well, I mean, you asked the question of how are we going to get people to trust us again? The first thing is weâ€™ve got to boot Donald Trump out of the Oval Office so that people will trust us again. I also want people to think, the folks this week that saw those images of ISIS prisoners running free, to think about how absurd it is that this president is caging kids on the border, and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free.
