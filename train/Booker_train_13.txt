Cory Booker: Strategies like investing in our children work. And I’ll tell you this, I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated, disconnected from other issues. That’s why my friend Secretary Castro was 100% right. We are in the reality we are right now because, Vice President, of overtly racist policies, not 400 years ago, just in my lifetime. That were redlining communities, disinvesting in communities and more than just that, my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation and housing and the challenges of under-funded schools, but they’re also struggling with environmental injustice. If you’ve talked to someone who’s a parent of a child who’s had permanent brain damage because of lead, you’ll know this is a national problem, because there’s over 3,000 jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint, Michigan.
