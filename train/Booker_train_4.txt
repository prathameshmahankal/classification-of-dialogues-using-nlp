Cory Booker: I joined together and led in the United States Senate, the only major bipartisan bill to pass under this President, for criminal justice reform, that has already led to thousands of people coming out of jail. If 87 members of the United States Senate says that these sentences are way too long and we changed it, but we didn’t make it retroactive, we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now. Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17,000 people. And I challenge you, don’t just say big statements, back it up with details of the people in prison right now, looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation, which is liberty and freedom. We need to reform this system and we must do it now. Every day we wait is too long.
