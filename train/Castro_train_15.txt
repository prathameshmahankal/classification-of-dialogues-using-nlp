Julian Castro: Thanks a lot, Erin. And you see that everybody has their own plans. And let me just say that the way that I view this is born out of my own experience. I grew up, like I bet a lot of folks in this room grew up and folks that are watching on TV, I grew up with my twin brother Joaquin in a single-parent household where my mom was working hard to support us, and also her mom, my grandmother, and we knew what it was like to wonder whether we were going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month. Or sometimes have the electricity turned off. And when I was a kid to look at the grocery lists that seemed to get shorter and shorter. And that’s what’s happening to a lot of families these days.
