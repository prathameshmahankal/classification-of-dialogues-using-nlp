Amy Klobuchar: This is a pattern with this man and it goes to everything from how he has betrayed our farmers and our workers to what he has done with foreign affairs, leaving the Kurds for slaughter, sucking up to Vladimir Putin every minute of the day. That is what this guy does. And I think it is very, very important that we have a president that’s going to put our country first. So, I was thinking about this when I was at the Carter Presidential Museum and on the wall are etched the words of Walter Mondale when he looked back at their four years, not perfect. And he said this, “We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace.” We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace. That is the minimum that we should expect in a President of the United States.
