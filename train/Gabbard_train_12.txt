Tulsi Gabbard: Transitioning our country off of fossil fuels and ending the nearly $30 billion in subsidies that we as taxpayers are currently giving to the fossil fuel industry instead of investing in a green renewable energy economy that leads us into the 21st century with good paying jobs, a sustainable economy, investing in infrastructure and transitioning our agriculture that is a great contributor to the environmental threats we face towards an agriculture system that focuses on local and regional production of food, healthy food that will actually feed the health and wellbeing of our people, leading as a leader in the world to make the global change necessary to address these threats.
