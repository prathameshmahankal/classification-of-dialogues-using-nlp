Pete Buttigieg: Step one is, appoint a secretary of education who actually believes in public education. I believe in public education and in order to strengthen it, some things are very complex for preparing for a future where knowledge is at your fingertips, but we’ve got to teach more to do with critical thinking and social and emotional learning. Some of it is extremely simple, we’ve just got to pay teachers more, and we’ve got to lift up the teaching profession. I was thinking of a story from South Bend of friends who hosted exchange students from Japan, they had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher and they kept in touch with her when she went back to Japan and to college. She took the exam to try to become a teacher in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well, and she came up just short, so you know what she did, since she was academically good but couldn’t quite make the cut to be a teacher, she had a fall back plan, she became a doctor. That is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession. If we want to get the results that we expect for our children, we have to support and compensate the teaching profession. Respect teachers the way we do soldiers and pay them more like the way we do doctors.
