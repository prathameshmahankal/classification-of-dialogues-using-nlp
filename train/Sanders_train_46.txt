Bernie Sanders: But I think at the end of the day, what I appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that Trump is fostering on our people, the divisiveness, trying to divide us up by the color of our skin, or where we were born, or our sexual orientation, or our religion. And there is no job that I would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man, woman and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1%. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country.
