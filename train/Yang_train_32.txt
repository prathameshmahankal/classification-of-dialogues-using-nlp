Andrew Yang: And the people in Washington DC had nothing for this. They don’t want to touch it, they don’t want to talk about an issue they don’t think they have a solution for. I’m not running for president because I’ve fantasized about being president, I’m running for president because like many of you here in this room tonight, I’m a parent and a patriot, and I have seen the future that we’re leaving for our kids, and it is not something I’m willing to accept. We need to create a new way forward for our people. If you want to join us in rewriting the rules of the 21st century economy, go to yang2020.com and make it so that we can look our kids in the eyes and say to them, and believe it, “Your country loves you, your country values you, and you will be alright.”
