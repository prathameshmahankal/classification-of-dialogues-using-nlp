Cory Booker: I’m so grateful, again, as a mayor who was a mayor during a recession, who was a mayor during a housing crisis, who started my career as a tenants’ rights lawyer, these are all good points. But we’re not talking about something that is going on all over America, which is gentrification, and low income families being moved further and further out, often compounding racial segregation. And so all of these things we need to put more federal dollars in it, but we’ve got to start empowering people. We use our tax code to move wealth up. The mortgage interest deduction. My plan is very simple. If you are a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent, then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount you’re paying and the area median rent. That empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners. And what that does is it actually slashes poverty, 10 million people out. And, by the way, for those people who are facing eviction, it is about time that the only people, when they show up in rentals court that have a lawyer it’s not the landlord, it is also low-income family struggling to stay in their home.
