Kamala Harris: They have… And I’ve seen it happen before. I’ve taken on the pharmaceutical companies when I was attorney general of California and led the second largest Department of Justice. I’ve seen what they do. The biggest pharmaceutical companies, the eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies last year profited $72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis, which is a public health epidemic. And they knew what they were doing. They were marketing, false advertising. They knew what they were pushing in communities and states like Ohio, without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks. And yes, they should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice. And so as president of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department of Justice understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal? Let’s end mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs and let’s go after these pharmaceutical companies for what they’ve been doing to destroy our country and states like Ohio.
