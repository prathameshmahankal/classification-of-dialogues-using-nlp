Beto O'Rourke: I’ve always tried to bring people in to the solutions that we have to our common challenges regardless of the differences. I did that as a small business owner more than 20 years ago, making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in El Paso, Texas. Did it as a member of the city council where I saw my colleagues not as Republicans or Democrats but my fellow El Pasoans who had a responsibility to deliver for our community. As a member of Congress I remember being in San Antonio, I was visiting the VA there March of 2017, I found that my flight had been snowed in in Washington, DC. I happened to be in the elevator with a Republican member of Congress, Will Hurd, and on a whim I said, “Do you want to just rent a car and drive from San Antonio to Washington?” And he called my bluff, we got in that Chevy Impala, last car on the lot, it was spring break, drove 1600 miles across the country, live streamed the conversation, a Republican and a Democrat finding out what we had in common.
