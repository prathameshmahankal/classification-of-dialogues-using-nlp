Cory Booker: My biggest professional setback is embarrassing ’cause a lot of folks know about it. I with a bunch of tenant leaders in New York, New Jersey in 2002, took on the political machine, and boy, did they fight back. I had tires on my car slashed, our campaign offices were broken into, my phones were tapped, it became a spectacle and we lost that election. And here’s a bit of advice to everybody, if you’re going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it, because it made for an Oscar-nominated documentary called Street Fight. But then unfortunately, another setback, it lost in the Oscars to a movie called March of the dagnab Penguins for crying out loud. The people in my community living in the projects told me, “Don’t give up on the people and the people won’t give up on you. Create bigger and bolder coalitions and you’re going to win.”
