Bernie Sanders: I get a little bit tired, I must say, of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel. 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt. For what reason? They came down with cancer. I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the healthcare industry, which made $100 billion in profit. Whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. And if we donâ€™t have the guts to do that, if all we could do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.
