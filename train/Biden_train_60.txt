Joe Biden: I’m so tired of everybody walking around like, “Woe is me. What are we going to do?” Let’s remember, this is the United States of America. There has never, ever, ever been a time when we set our mind to do something, we’ve been unable to do it. Never. Never, never. So it’s time to remember the word, get up! Let’s take back this country and lead the world again, it’s within our power to do it. Get up and take it back!
