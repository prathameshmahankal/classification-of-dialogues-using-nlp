Andrew Yang: I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors. And they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy. We have to change the incentive. So instead of revenue and activity, people are focused on our health in the healthcare system. And the Cleveland Clinic, where theyâ€™re paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe. Shocker, they prescribe fewer procedures and patient health stays the same or improves. That is the pitch to the American people.
