Pete Buttigieg: That’s right. When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court, some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate. Now, I’m not talking about packing the court just with people who agree with me, although I certainly will appoint people who share my values. For example, the idea that women’s reproductive freedom is an American right. What I’m talking about is reforms that will de-politicize the court. We can’t go on like this where every single time there is a vacancy, we have this apocalyptic ideological fire fight over what to do next. Now, one way to fix this would be to have a 15-member court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10. Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal on how this could be done without a constitutional amendment. But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis. There are other reforms that we could consider, from term limits, don’t forget justices used to just retire like everybody else, to a rotation off the appellate bench.
