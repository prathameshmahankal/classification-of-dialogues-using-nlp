Kamala Harris: So let’s talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. We all fought against it and then the late, great John McCain, at that moment at about 2 o’clock in the morning, killed his attempt to take healthcare from millions of people in this country. Fast forward to today, and what is happening? Donald Trump’s Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Donald Trump’s administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have pre-existing conditions coverage. Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans. And frankly, I think this discussion has given the American public a headache. What they want to know is that they’re going to have healthcare and cost will not be a barrier to getting it, but let’s focus on the end goal. If we don’t get Donald Trump out of office, he’s going to get rid of all of it.
