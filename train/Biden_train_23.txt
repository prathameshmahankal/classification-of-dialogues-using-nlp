Joe Biden: Yes, they have. I said from the beginning, that if in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller Report. If they did that, they would have no choice, no choice but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information. This president, and I agree with Bernie, Bernie Sanders, is the most corrupt president in modern history, and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that in fact he will not cooperate in any way at all. Will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.
