Elizabeth Warren: I grew up out in Oklahoma, I have three older brothers, they all served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers. And there are a lot of things that we’re divided on, but there are core things that we believe in together. We want to see all of our children get a good start in life, we don’t want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by healthcare, we’re willing to get out there for the things we believe in. Look, people across this country, whether they’re Democrats, independents or Republicans, they know what’s broken, they know that we have an America that’s working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top, and leaving everyone else behind. People across this country regardless of party are ready to say, no more. We want an America that works for everyone. 2020 is our moment in history.
