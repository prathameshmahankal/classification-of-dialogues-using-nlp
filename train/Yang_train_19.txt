Andrew Yang: So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our communities, so our people have a fighting chance to get well. Even though this is not a money problem, we all know this is a human problem. And part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they’re not going to be referred to a prison cell. They will be referred to treatment and counseling. I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire, and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again, because the fact is after you save someone who’s OD’ing, you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week. So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use. We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing, this was a systemic government failing, and then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country, because they save lives.
