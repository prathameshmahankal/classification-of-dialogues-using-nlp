Andrew Yang: I’m here with my wife Evelyn tonight. We have two young boys, Christopher and Damian. How many of you all are parents like us here in the room? So if you are a parent you’ve had this thought, maybe you’ve been afraid to express it, and it is this. Our kids are not alright, they’re not alright because we’re leaving them a future that is far darker than the lives that we have led as their parents. We are going through the greatest economic transformation in our country’s history, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and it is pushing more and more of our people to the side. We talk as if Donald Trump is the cause of all of our problems, he is not, he is a symptom, and we need to cure the disease. Now, my first move was not to run for president of the United States, because I am not insane. My first move was to go to DC talk to our leaders and say, “Technology is ripping us apart, immigrants are being scapegoated, our kids are being left behind and the American Dream that my parents came here to find is dying before our eyes.”
