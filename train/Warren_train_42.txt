Elizabeth Warren: So let’s be clear, whenever someone hears the term Medicare for all who want it, understand what that really means, it’s Medicare for all who can afford it, and that’s the problem we’ve got. Medicare for all is the gold standard, it is the way we get healthcare coverage for every single American, including the family whose child has been diagnosed with cancer, including the person who’s just gotten an Tom Steyer diagnosis, that’s how we make sure that everyone gets healthcare. We can pay for this, I’ve laid out the basic principles, costs are going to go up for the wealthy, they’re going to go up for big corporations, they will not go up for middle class families and I will not sign a bill into law if that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about. I’ve been studying this for the biggest part of my life, why people go bankrupt.
