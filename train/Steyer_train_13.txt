Tom Steyer: I understand exactly what needs to be done here, which is we need to change policy and we need to apply resources here to make sure that we build literally millions of new units. But the other thing that’s going to be true about building these units is we’re going to have to build them in a way that’s sustainable. That, in fact, how we build units, where people live, has a dramatic impact on climate and on sustainability. So, we are going to have to direct dollars, we’re going to have to change policy and make sure that the localities and municipalities who’ve worked very hard to make sure that there are no new housing units built in their towns, that they have to change that and we’re going to have to force it and then we’re going to have to direct federal dollars to make sure that those units are affordable so that working people can live in places and not be spending 50% of their income on rent.
