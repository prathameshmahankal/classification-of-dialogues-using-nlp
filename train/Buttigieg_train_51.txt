Pete Buttigieg: We need to reprioritize our budget as a whole and our military spending in particular. It’s not just how much, although we certainly need to look at the runaway growth in military spending, it’s also where. Right now, we are spending a fraction of the intention and resources on things like the artificial intelligence research that China is doing right now. If we both fall behind on artificial intelligence, the most expensive ships that the United States is building, just turn into bigger targets. We do not have a 21st century security strategy coming from this president. After all, he’s relying on 17th century security technologies like a moat full of alligators or a big wall. There is no concept of strategic planning for how civilian, diplomatic and military security work needs to take place for the future.
