Elizabeth Warren: Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment, but when the Mueller Report came out, I read it: All 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown, too, a fare-thee-well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so, at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry.
