Bernie Sanders: To the original point. The American people understand that the political system we have today is corrupt. And it is not just voter suppression which cost the Democratic Party a governorship here in this state, not just denying Black people or people of color the right to vote, but we also have a system, through Citizens United, which allows billionaires to buy elections. So, what we need to do, simple and straightforward, in every state in this country, through the federal government, if you are 18, you have a right to vote, end of discussion. We have to overturn Citizens United, we need to move towards public funding of elections.
