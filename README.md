# classification-of-dialogues-using-nlp

This problem was a part of the assignment for the IMT 575 course at the UW. Student with the best model in the class was asked to provide a short video explaining the approach. I have attached the video in the repo as well.

In this problem, I have performed supervised text classification. The data for the classification task will consist of quotes from candidates vying to be the Democratic presidential nominee for the 2020 US presidential election. All data has been extracted from
debates between candidates. The task is to identify who said what for a subset of unlabeled data.
